Franklin Delano Roosevelt, often referred to by his initials FDR, was the 32nd President of the [United States](./../united-states/), serving from 1933 until his death in 1945. His presidency is largely defined by his response to the [Great Depression](./../great-depression/) and his leadership during World War II.

## Key Events and Associations:

*   **[Great Depression](./../great-depression/):** FDR inherited the economic crisis triggered by the [Stock Market Crash of 1929](./../stock-market-crash-of-1929/). His administration implemented the [New Deal](./../new-deal/), a series of programs and reforms aimed at relief, recovery, and reform.

    *   **Criticisms:** The New Deal was criticized by some conservatives for expanding the role of the federal government and increasing national debt. Some liberals argued it did not go far enough in addressing economic inequality.
*   **World War II:** Initially, FDR maintained a policy of neutrality, but the [Pearl Harbor Attack](./../pearl-harbor-attack/) in 1941 led the US to enter World War II. He played a crucial role in forming the [Allied Powers](./../allied-powers/) and strategizing for victory.
*   **Pearl Harbor:** Before the attack, FDR ordered an oil embargo on Japan, which was attempting to expand its empire into Asia. On December 7th, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor which led to the US joining WWII.

## Important Legislation and Programs:

*   **Emergency Banking Act (1933):** This act addressed the banking crisis by providing for the reopening of banks under strict regulation and federal oversight. It also established the [FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation)](./../fdic-(federal-deposit-insurance-corporation)/) to ensure bank deposits.
*   **[AAA (Agricultural Adjustment Act)](./../aaa-(agricultural-adjustment-act)/):** Aimed to raise agricultural prices by limiting production. Farmers were paid subsidies to reduce their acreage and crops. It was later declared unconstitutional but replaced with revised legislation.

*   **Controversies:** While immensely popular, FDR's presidency also faced criticism. Some conservatives opposed the expansion of government power and the growth of the national debt. Others criticized his handling of foreign policy prior to World War II, arguing he should have intervened sooner.
