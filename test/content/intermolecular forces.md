# Uses little delta δ symbol

## Atoms in molecules have partial charges because electrons are goofy 

#  $$ Na^{δ+}\ \ \textemdash\ \ \ Cl^{δ-} $$  - High [Polarity](./../polarity/) molecules will have high intermolecular attraction 
	-  Things will attract each other a certain amount based on [Electronegativity](./../electronegativity/)
	- **All Ionic Compounds are polar** because all the positive sides of ionic molecules have low electronegativity
	- Covalent Compounds get polarity based on the [delta](./../delta/) of their electronegativity
	- See [Polarity](./../polarity/)
# [Dipole Dipole](./../dipole-dipole/): Opposites attract
# [London Dispersion](./../london-dispersion/): Dipoles randomly form because an electron randomly stepped out of place
# [Hydrogen Bonds](./../hydrogen-bonds/): Dipole Dipole but with hydrogen
