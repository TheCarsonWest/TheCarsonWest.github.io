# Uses little delta δ symbol(different than [delta symbol](./../delta-symbol/))

## Atoms in molecules have partial charges because electrons are goofy 
## IMFS are never as strong as [Chemical Bonds](./../chemical-bonds/)
#  $$ Na^{δ+}\ \ \textemdash\ \ \ Cl^{δ-} $$  - High [Polarity](./../polarity/) molecules will have high intermolecular attraction 
	-  Things will attract each other a certain amount based on [Electronegativity](./../electronegativity/)
	- **All Ionic Compounds are polar** because all the positive sides of ionic molecules have low [Electronegativity](./../electronegativity/)
	- Covalent Compounds get [Polarity](./../polarity/) based on the [delta symbol](./../delta-symbol/) of their [Electronegativity](./../electronegativity/)
	- See [Polarity](./../polarity/)


# Van Der Waals IMFs
van der waals is a fancy way of saying these are the ones that exist between **identical molecules**
## Dipole Dipole: Opposites attract
- Only occurs in polar molecules
- HBr is a highly polar molecule, and the Br will be attracted to other molecules' hydrogens
## [London Dispersion](./../london-dispersion/)
## [Hydrogen Bonds](./../hydrogen-bonds/)
# Non Van Der Waals IMFs
## Ion Dipole: An ion attracts a [dipole](./../dipole/)

# What IMFs do
## Kinetic energy
- More IMF means less movement
- **Things with strong IMFs will typically have a higher boiling point**
	- Gases: least IMF
- The existence of IMF creates the states of matter solids and liquid
## Boiling point
- More IMF = more boiling
- Weak attractions increases non-agitated evaporation
	- A cup of water left open in a dark room at room [Temperature](./../temperature/) will fully evaporate in 5 days
	- A glass of isopropyl will evaporate in the same conditions in 2 days
