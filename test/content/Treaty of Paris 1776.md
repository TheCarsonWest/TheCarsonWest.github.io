(Specific boundaries were a subject of later disputes).
* **Fishing Rights:** Secured fishing rights for Americans off the coast of Newfoundland.
* **Return of Loyalists' Property:**  While the treaty addressed the issue of the return of Loyalist property, this provision was largely unenforced.
* **End of Hostilities:** Formal conclusion of the war, bringing an end to fighting between the two nations.
* **Impact on Native Americans:** The treaty largely ignored the rights of Native Americans who had allied with [Great Britain](./../great-britain/), leading to continued conflict and westward expansion.  British cession of western lands to the US led to displacement and conflict with Native American populations.
