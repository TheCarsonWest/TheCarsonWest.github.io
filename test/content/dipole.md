### Dipoles are [Covalent Bonds](./../covalent-bonds/) with a high [Polarity](./../polarity/)
### used in [intermolecular forces](./../intermolecular-forces/)

### Dipole Moment formula
### More moment = more polar
#  $$  µ = Qr  $$  - µ: Strength
- Q: Quantity of charge(magnitude of charges)
- R: distance
basically a high [dipole](./../dipole/) strength is a result of the atoms pulling each other in and having a lot of charge. Just look at [Electronegativity](./../electronegativity/) it gives the same info
