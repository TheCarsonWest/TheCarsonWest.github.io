# ID: Proclamation of Neutrality 
## When: April 22, 1793
## Who: 
Issued by President George [Washington](./../washington/) 
## What:
Declared the [United States](./../united-states/)' official neutrality in the conflict between [Great Britain](./../great-britain/) and [France](./../france/).  It prohibited Americans from fighting for either side and barred French and British warships from American ports.
## Impact? Why Significant?: 
- Established a precedent of American neutrality in foreign wars, a principle largely followed throughout the 19th century. 
-  Angered pro-French Democratic-Republicans who felt obligated to help [France](./../france/), leading to increased political partisanship between the Federalists and Democratic-Republicans.
-  Contributed to strained relations with [France](./../france/), ultimately leading to the Quasi-War (an undeclared naval war) between 1798 and 1800.
