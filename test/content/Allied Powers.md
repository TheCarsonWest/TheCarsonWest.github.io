## ID: [Allied Powers](./../allied-powers/)' Entry into WWI

## When: September [5](./../5/), 1914 (and ongoing)

## Who:
* **[Allied Powers](./../allied-powers/):** Primarily [Great Britain](./../great-britain/), [France](./../france/), and Russia (later joined by the [United States](./../united-states/), Italy, Japan, and others).
* **[Central Powers](./../central-powers/):** Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria

## What: 
Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28, 1914, a series of alliances triggered a rapid escalation into a large-scale European conflict. By September 5th, 1914,  the [Allied Powers](./../allied-powers/) (primarily [Great Britain](./../great-britain/), [France](./../france/), and Russia) were formally at war with the [Central Powers](./../central-powers/) (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and their allies).  This marked the beginning of the major phase of fighting in World War I.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Global Conflict:** The involvement of the [Allied Powers](./../allied-powers/) transformed a European conflict into a global war, drawing in nations across continents.
* **American Neutrality (Initially):** The US initially declared neutrality, but increasing German aggression (unrestricted submarine warfare, [Zimmerman Telegram](./../zimmerman-telegram/)) eventually led to US entry in 1917.
* **Shift in Global Power:** WWI dramatically reshaped the global balance of power, leading to the decline of European empires and the rise of the [United States](./../united-states/) as a major global power.
* **Economic Impact:** The war had a profound impact on the American economy, boosting industrial production, and accelerating the transition to a mass-production economy.
* **Social Change:** The war significantly impacted American society, spurring social and political reforms, but also fueling anxieties about social unrest and radicalism (Red Scare).
* **[Treaty of Versailles](./../treaty-of-versailles/) & [League of Nations](./../league-of-nations/):** The eventual Allied victory shaped the [Treaty of Versailles](./../treaty-of-versailles/), which imposed harsh terms on Germany and led to the creation of the [League of Nations](./../league-of-nations/) (although the US did not join). The consequences of the treaty contributed to the rise of extremist ideologies and ultimately to WWII.
