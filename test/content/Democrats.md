# The [Democrats](./../democrats/) ### Symbol: donkey, because they are ass
The Democratic Party, one of the two major political parties in the [United States](./../united-states/), boasts a long and complex history, evolving alongside the nation itself. Its roots trace back to the \
Democrat party: Founded by [Andrew Jackson](./../andrew-jackson/) after he lost to [John Quincy Adams](./../john-quincy-adams/) in the [election of 1824](./../election-of-1824/), where he and his people split from the [Democratic-Republican](./../democratic-republican/)s


## **The Early Years (1800-1828):**

* **[Andrew Jackson](./../andrew-jackson/):** The "[Era of Good Feelings](./../era-of-good-feelings/)" gave way to a more partisan era with the rise of **[Andrew Jackson](./../andrew-jackson/)**, a war hero and populist leader who embraced the label "Democrat" and advocated for the "common man." His presidency marked a shift towards a more democratic system, expanding suffrage and challenging the elite.

## **The Jacksonian Era (1828-1850s):**

* **States' Rights:** The Democratic Party of this era championed states' rights, opposing federal intervention in matters like slavery and tariffs.
* **Expansionism:**  Driven by **Manifest Destiny**, [Democrats](./../democrats/) supported westward expansion, leading to the acquisition of vast territories and the Mexican-American War.
* **Slavery:** The issue of slavery increasingly divided the party, with Southern [Democrats](./../democrats/) defending it and Northern [Democrats](./../democrats/) advocating for gradual abolition or restriction.

## **The [Civil War](./../civil-war/) and Reconstruction (1860-1877):**

* **Division:** The split over slavery led to the formation of the **Republican Party** in 1854, and the Democratic Party fractured into Northern and Southern factions.
* **Confederacy:**  Southern [Democrats](./../democrats/) supported secession and formed the Confederate States of America.
* **Reconstruction:** After the [Civil War](./../civil-war/), the Democratic Party, though weakened, opposed Reconstruction efforts, seeking to limit the rights of former slaves.

## **The [Gilded Age](./../gilded-age/) and [Progressivism](./../progressivism/) (1877-1917):**

* **Industrialization:** The Democratic Party grappled with the challenges of industrialization, often supporting [labor unions](./../labor-unions/) and advocating for reform.
* **Populism:** The party embraced populist movements, such a[Populist Party|s the **Populi](./../populist-party|s-the-**populi/)st Party** in the 1890s, which championed farmers' rights and challenged corporate power.
* **[Progressivism](./../progressivism/):**  Some [Democrats](./../democrats/) embraced the Progressive movement, advocating for social justice and government regulation.

## **The 20th Century:**

* **New Deal:** **[Franklin D. Roosevelt](./../franklin-d.-roosevelt/)**'s presidency marked a significant shift, ushering in the **New Deal**, a series of programs aimed at addressing the Great Depression. This era cemented the Democratic Party's association with social welfare programs and government intervention in the economy.
* **Civil Rights:**  The Democratic Party played a crucial role in the Civil Rights Movement, with figures like **[Lyndon B. Johnson](./../lyndon-b.-johnson/)** pushing for legislation to dismantle segregation and ensure equal rights.
* **Cold War:**  The party navigated the Cold War, supporting the containment of communism while also advocating for diplomacy and peaceful coexistence.

## **The Modern Era:**

* **Liberal Shift:** The Democratic Party has become increasingly identified with liberal values, advocating for social justice, environmental protection, and government intervention in the economy(socialism).
* **Social Issues:** They want to take your guns, make you gay, and pretend to care about minorities to get their vote(so that they can do nothing for them).
