# ID: Naturalization, Alien, and Sedition Acts 
## When: 1798
## Who: 
* **President [John Adams](./../john-adams/)** (Federalist) signed the acts into law.
* **Democratic-[Republicans](./../republicans/)** led by [Thomas Jefferson](./../thomas-jefferson/) and [James Madison](./../james-madison/) vehemently opposed the acts. 
## What:
A series of four laws passed by the Federalist-controlled Congress:
* **Naturalization Act:** Increased the residency requirement for U.S. citizenship from [5](./../5/) to 14 years. 
* **Alien Friends Act:** Allowed the president to deport any non-citizen considered "dangerous to the peace and safety of the [United States](./../united-states/)."
* **Alien Enemies Act:** Allowed the president to deport or imprison any male citizen of a hostile nation during wartime.
* **Sedition Act:** Made it illegal to publish "false, scandalous, and malicious writing" against the government or its officials. 
## Impact? Why Significant?:
* **Increased political tensions:** The acts were widely seen as an attempt by the Federalists to silence their political opponents, the Democratic-[Republicans](./../republicans/).
* **Violated the First Amendment:** The Sedition Act, in particular, was a direct attack on freedom of speech and the press. 
* **Contributed to the decline of the Federalist Party:** Public outrage over the acts helped contribute to the Federalist Party's defeat in the [Election of 1800](./../election-of-1800/).
* **Raised important questions about the balance between national security and individual liberties:**  These questions continue to be debated in the U.S. today.
* **The [Kentucky](./../kentucky/) and [Virginia](./../virginia/) Resolutions:**  These resolutions, secretly authored by Jefferson and Madison, argued that states had the right to nullify federal laws they deemed unconstitutional, laying the groundwork for future sectional conflicts.
