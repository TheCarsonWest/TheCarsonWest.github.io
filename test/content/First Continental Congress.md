## ID: [First Continental Congress](./../first-continental-congress/) 
## When: September [5](./../5/) â€“ October 26, 1774

## Who:
* Delegates from twelve of the thirteen colonies ([Georgia](./../georgia/) did not attend).  Represented a broad spectrum of colonial society, including merchants, lawyers, planters, and some artisans.  Key figures included Patrick Henry, [Samuel Adams](./../samuel-adams/), [John Adams](./../john-adams/), George [Washington](./../washington/), and Joseph Galloway.

## What:
The [First Continental Congress](./../first-continental-congress/) was a meeting of delegates from twelve of the thirteen British colonies in North America.  It was convened in response to the [Intolerable Acts](./../intolerable-acts/), a series of punitive measures imposed by the British government after the [Boston Tea Party](./../boston-tea-party/).  The Congress aimed to address colonial grievances against British policies and coordinate a unified response.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Declaration of Rights and Grievances:** The Congress issued a Declaration of Rights and Grievances, outlining colonial rights and protesting against British policies like taxation without representation and the quartering of troops.  This document articulated a formal opposition to British rule.
* **Establishment of the Continental Association:** The Congress created the Continental Association, a system of boycotts against British goods. This economic pressure was intended to force Britain to reconsider its policies.
* **Call for a Second Congress:**  Recognizing the need for continued unity and action, the Congress agreed to reconvene if grievances were not addressed. This laid the groundwork for further colonial resistance.
* **Show of Colonial Unity:**  The Congress demonstrated a significant level of intercolonial cooperation and coordination, foreshadowing the eventual move towards independence. The very act of convening represented a powerful challenge to British authority.
* **Shift in Colonial Sentiment:** The Congress marked a crucial shift in colonial sentiment. While not initially advocating for independence, it set the stage for more radical actions in the coming years.
