## When:  1861 - 1865 (During the American [Civil War](./../civil-war/))

## Who:  
* **General Winfield Scott:**  The Union's General-in-Chief, who formulated the strategy.
* **President [Abraham Lincoln](./../abraham-lincoln/):**  Approved and authorized the plan.

## What: 
The [Anaconda Plan](./../anaconda-plan/) was a strategic military plan devised by Union General Winfield Scott to blockade Confederate ports, control the [Mississippi](./../mississippi/) River, and gradually squeeze the Confederacy into submission.  This strategy aimed to cut off the South's supply lines, cripple its economy, and ultimately force its surrender.

## Impact: Why Significant? 
The [Anaconda Plan](./../anaconda-plan/) significantly impacted the course of the [Civil War](./../civil-war/). It: 

* **Established a naval blockade:** This effectively choked off Southern trade and exports, weakening the Confederate economy. 
* **Controlled the [Mississippi](./../mississippi/) River:**  Cutting off the South's ability to transport resources and troops.
* **Gradual pressure on the Confederacy:** It helped to isolate the South and make its surrender more likely. 
* **Prolonged the War:** While effective, the strategy was slow, leading to a long and bloody conflict. 

The [Anaconda Plan](./../anaconda-plan/), though initially criticized for its slow pace, proved highly effective in bringing about the Union victory in the [Civil War](./../civil-war/).
