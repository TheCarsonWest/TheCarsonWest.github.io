## [Titration](./../Titration/) is a type of [Double replacement reaction](./../Double-replacement-reaction/) in which:
- ### you have a known [molarity](./../molarity/) of one reactant
- ### You have an unknown [molarity](./../molarity/) of another,
- ### you [Double replacement reaction](./../Double-replacement-reaction/)#neutralization|neutralize]] the solution
- ### You do math the find the [molarity](./../molarity/) of the other
