# [AP CHEM solutions](./../ap-chem-solutions/) [Distillation](./../distillation/) is a separation technique used to purify liquids based on differences in their boiling points.  It leverages the fact that in a mixture, each component will exert its own [vapor pressure](./../vapor-pressure/), and the more volatile component (the one with the lower boiling point) will have a higher [vapor pressure](./../vapor-pressure/).

## Basic Principles

* **[Vapor Pressure](./../vapor-pressure/):** [Vapor Pressure](./../vapor-pressure/)  The pressure exerted by a vapor in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases (liquid or solid) at a given temperature in a closed system.
* **Boiling Point:** The temperature at which the [vapor pressure](./../vapor-pressure/) of a liquid equals the external pressure surrounding the liquid.
* **[partial pressure](./../partial-pressure/):**  In a mixture of gases, each gas exerts its own [partial pressure](./../partial-pressure/).  The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of all the gases present.  
* **[Raoults Law](./../raoults-law/):**  [Raoults Law](./../raoults-law/) For an ideal solution, the [partial pressure](./../partial-pressure/) of each component is equal to the product of the pure component's [vapor pressure](./../vapor-pressure/) and its mole fraction in the liquid mixture.  Mathematically:

###  $$ P_A = x_A P_A^* $$  
where:

*  $ P_A $  is the [partial pressure](./../partial-pressure/) of component A
*  $ x_A $  is the mole fraction of component A in the liquid phase
*  $ P_A^* $  is the [vapor pressure](./../vapor-pressure/) of pure component A

## Simple [Distillation](./../distillation/) 
Simple distillation is effective for separating liquids with significantly different boiling points (generally a difference of at least 25Â°C).  The mixture is heated, and the more volatile component vaporizes first.  The vapor is then cooled and condensed back into a liquid, which is collected separately.

## Fractional [Distillation](./../distillation/) 
Fractional distillation is used to separate liquids with closer boiling points.  It employs a fractionating column, which provides a large surface area for multiple condensation and vaporization cycles. As the vapor rises through the column, it repeatedly condenses and re-vaporizes.  With each cycle, the vapor becomes richer in the more volatile component.  This process effectively creates a temperature gradient along the column, allowing for finer separation.

## Limitations of [Distillation](./../distillation/) 
* **[Azeotropes](./../azeotropes/):** [Azeotropes](./../azeotropes/) Some mixtures form [Azeotropes](./../azeotropes/), which are constant boiling mixtures that cannot be separated by simple distillation.
* **[Heat](./../heat/) sensitive compounds:**  Some compounds decompose at high temperatures, making distillation unsuitable.
* **Energy intensive:** [Distillation](./../distillation/) can be an energy-intensive process, especially for large-scale operations.
