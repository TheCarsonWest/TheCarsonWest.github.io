This document outlines various techniques for integrating sources into a written work.  Focus is on proper attribution and avoiding plagiarism.

## [Citation Management](./../citation-management/)

*   Different citation styles (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.)  [Citation Styles](./../citation-styles/)
*   Software tools (Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote) [Citation Management Software](./../citation-management-software/)


## Direct Quotations

*   Use sparingly.  Overuse weakens writing.
*   Always enclose in quotation marks.
*   Introduce quote with signal phrase (e.g., "According to Smith...")
*   Include page number (or equivalent) in citation.

Example: "This is a direct quote" (Smith 123).


## Paraphrasing

*   Restate information in your own words.
*   Maintain original meaning.
*   Always cite the source.

Example: Smith argues that... (Smith 123).


## Summarizing

*   Condensing main ideas from a source.
*   Focus on key arguments and evidence.
*   Cite the source.

Example:  The study's findings support the hypothesis that... (Smith et al., 2023).


## Synthesizing Sources

*   Combining information from multiple sources to support your argument.
*   Show how sources relate to each other.
*   Avoid simply listing sources; create a cohesive narrative.  [Synthesis Techniques](./../synthesis-techniques/)


## [Avoiding Plagiarism](./../avoiding-plagiarism/)

*   Proper citation is crucial.
*   Paraphrase and summarize effectively.
*   Use quotation marks correctly.
*   Understand your institution's plagiarism policy. [Academic Honesty](./../academic-honesty/)


##  Mathematical Formula Integration (Example)

Suppose we have a function  $ f(x) = x^2 $ .  The integral of this function from  $ a $  to  $ b $  is given by:

 $$  \int_a^b x^2 dx = \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_a^b = \frac{b^3}{3} - \frac{a^3}{3}  $$  
This needs to be cited if taken from a source.  Remember to cite the source of the formula if it's not common knowledge.  [Mathematical Citation](./../mathematical-citation/)


##  Image and Figure Integration

*   Always cite the source of images and figures, even if they are from the public domain. [Image Attribution](./../image-attribution/)


##  Data Integration

*   Clearly state the source of data.
*   Explain any transformations or manipulations performed on the data. [Data Handling and Citation](./../data-handling-and-citation/)
