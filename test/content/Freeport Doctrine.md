## ID: [Freeport Doctrine](./../freeport-doctrine/) 
## When: 1858

## Who: Stephen Douglas, a Democratic Senator from [Illinois](./../illinois/) 
## What: 
The [Freeport Doctrine](./../freeport-doctrine/) was a statement made by Douglas during the Lincoln-Douglas debates.  He argued that the people of a territory, not the federal government, should decide whether or not to allow slavery. This contradicted the Dred Scott decision which had stated that Congress could not prohibit slavery in the territories. 

## Impact: 
The [Freeport Doctrine](./../freeport-doctrine/) contributed to the growing [sectionalism](./../sectionalism/) in the US. It highlighted the differences between the North and South on the issue of slavery and ultimately led to the formation of the Republican Party and the eventual outbreak of the [Civil War](./../civil-war/). 

* **Impact on the Election:** Douglas's statement alienated some Southern [Democrats](./../democrats/) who opposed the idea of [popular sovereignty](./../popular-sovereignty/) on slavery. While Douglas won the Senate seat, the division within the [Democrats](./../democrats/) ultimately led to the election of [Abraham Lincoln](./../abraham-lincoln/), a Republican, as President. 
* **Impact on the Nation:** The [Freeport Doctrine](./../freeport-doctrine/) intensified the debate over slavery and further divided the nation.  It made it clear that the issue of slavery could not be ignored or compromised, ultimately leading to the [Civil War](./../civil-war/).
