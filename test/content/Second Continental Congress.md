## ID: [Second Continental Congress](./../second-continental-congress/) 
## When: May 10, 1775 â€“ March [1](./../1/), 1781

## Who:  Delegates from thirteen colonies (eventually)

## What:  A meeting of colonial delegates that initially aimed to organize colonial resistance against [Great Britain](./../great-britain/).  It evolved into the governing body of the newly independent [United States](./../united-states/).  Key actions included:

* **[Declaration of Independence](./../declaration-of-independence/) (July [4](./../4/), 1776):** Declared the thirteen colonies independent from [Great Britain](./../great-britain/).
* **[Articles of Confederation](./../articles-of-confederation/) (November 15, 1777):**  Created the first government of the [United States](./../united-states/), although it was weak and ultimately replaced by the Constitution.  (Note:  Ratified by states in 1781)
* **Appointing George [Washington](./../washington/) as Commander-in-Chief (June 15, 1775):**  A crucial step in unifying the Continental Army.
* **Raising and equipping a Continental Army:**  Organizing and funding the military effort against the British.
* **Issuing paper money:** Attempting to finance the war.
* **Establishing a post office:**  A vital service for communication during the war.
* **Negotiating treaties and alliances (with [France](./../france/), [Spain](./../spain/)):**  Securing vital foreign support for the war effort.


## Impact: Why Significant?:

* **Foundation of the [United States](./../united-states/):**  The [Second Continental Congress](./../second-continental-congress/) laid the groundwork for the new nation's government and military.
* **[Declaration of Independence](./../declaration-of-independence/):**  A defining moment in American history, formally declaring independence and outlining the principles of self-governance.
* **War Effort:** The Congress effectively managed (though imperfectly) the war against [Great Britain](./../great-britain/), crucial for securing independence.
* **Transition to a Nation:** The evolution from a resistance movement to a functioning government is a key turning point in American history.
* **Weaknesses Exposed:**  The [Articles of Confederation](./../articles-of-confederation/), produced during this time, highlighted the shortcomings of a weak central government. This experience informed the creation of the more robust system under the Constitution.
