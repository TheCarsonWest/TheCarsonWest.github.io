## [Heat](./../heat/)

[Heat](./../heat/) (q) is the transfer of thermal energy between objects at different temperatures.  [Heat](./../heat/) flows spontaneously from a hotter object to a colder object until thermal equilibrium is reached.  [Heat](./../heat/) is measured in Joules ([J](./../j/)) or calories (cal).  The relationship between heat and [Temperature](./../temperature/) change is given by:

 $$ q = mc\Delta T $$  
where:

* q = heat transferred
* m = mass of the substance
* c = specific heat capacity (the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of [1](./../1/) gram of a substance by [1](./../1/)°C)
* ΔT = change in temperature (final temperature - initial temperature)
