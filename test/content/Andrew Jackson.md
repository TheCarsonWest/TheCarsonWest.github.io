# Andrew Jackson: A Rundown
        
 ## Overview
         
 Andrew Jackson (1767-1845) was the 7th [POTUS](./../potus/) (1829-1837). A war hero and symbol of the common man, Jackson's presidency marked a significant shift in American politics, often referred to as the "Age of Jacksonian Democracy".
         
 ## Key Events and Associations
         
 *   **Military Career:**
  *  [Battle of New Orleans](./../battle-of-new-orleans/):  A major general in the War of 1812, Jackson achieved national fame for his decisive victory against the [Great Britain|British](./../great-britain|british/) at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815. This victory solidified his image as a military hero and propelled him into the political arena.
  *  [First Seminole War](./../first-seminole-war/): Led a controversial military campaign into [Florida](./../florida/) (then under [Spain|Spanish](./../spain|spanish/) control) in 1818, ostensibly to suppress Seminole Indian raids. This action led to the [Adams-Onis Treaty](./../adams-onis-treaty/), where [Spain](./../spain/) ceded [Florida](./../florida/) to the [United States](./../united-states/).
 *   **Presidential Elections:**
  *  [Election of 1824](./../election-of-1824/): Jackson won the popular vote but lost the election to John Quincy Adams in a controversial decision by the House of Representatives (the "Corrupt Bargain").
  *  [Election of 1828](./../election-of-1828/): Jackson won a landslide victory, ushering in an era of expanded suffrage and popular participation in politics.
  *  [Election of 1832](./../election-of-1832/): Jackson secured re-election, defeating Henry Clay. This election was heavily influenced by the "Bank War" controversy.
 *   **Presidency:**
  *  **[Spoils System](./../spoils-system/):** Jackson embraced the practice of rewarding political supporters with government positions, which became known as the "spoils system." This practice, although controversial, was justified by Jackson as a way to ensure government responsiveness to the will of the people.
  *  **[Indian Removal Act](./../indian-removal-act/):** Signed in 1830, this act authorized the forced relocation of Native American tribes from their ancestral lands in the Southeast to lands west of the Mississippi River. This led to the infamous [Trail of Tears](./../trail-of-tears/).
  *  **[Nullification Crisis](./../nullification-crisis/):** [South Carolina](./../south-carolina/) declared the federal tariffs of 1828 and 1832 null and void within its borders, challenging federal authority. Jackson firmly opposed nullification, threatening military action to enforce federal law. The crisis was eventually resolved through a compromise tariff.
  *  **[Bank War](./../bank-war/):** Jackson opposed the Second [Bank of the United States](./../bank-of-the-united-states/), viewing it as a corrupt and elitist institution. He vetoed the re-charter bill in 1832 and ultimately dismantled the bank by withdrawing federal funds.
         
 ## Important Legislation and Policies
         
 *   **[Indian Removal Act](./../indian-removal-act/) (1830):** Provided for the removal of Native American tribes to lands west of the Mississippi River.
 *   **Force Bill (1833):** Authorized the president to use military force to enforce federal laws in [South Carolina](./../south-carolina/) during the [Nullification Crisis](./../nullification-crisis/).
 *   **Veto of the Second Bank of the United States Re-charter Bill (1832):** A landmark veto that challenged the power of the national bank.
 *   **Distribution Act (1836):** Distributed surplus federal funds to the states.
         
 ## Groups and Affiliations

 *   **"Kitchen Cabinet":** Jackson relied on an informal group of advisors, often journalists and party organizers, rather than his official cabinet.
         
 ## Impact on the Country
         
 *   **Expansion of Suffrage:** Jacksonian Democracy led to the expansion of voting rights to all white men, regardless of property ownership.
 *   **Rise of Popular Politics:** Jackson's presidency marked a shift towards greater popular participation in politics, with more emphasis on campaigning and appealing to the common man.
 *   **Strengthening of the Presidency:** Jackson asserted presidential power through the use of the veto and his stance against [Nullification](./../nullification/), shaping the modern presidency.
 *   **Devastating Impact on Native Americans:** The [Indian Removal Act](./../indian-removal-act/) and its implementation resulted in the forced displacement and suffering of numerous Native American tribes.
 *   **Economic Instability:** Jackson's dismantling of the Second [Bank of the United States](./../bank-of-the-united-states/) contributed to economic instability and the [Panic of 1837](./../panic-of-1837/).
