**Key Features of the Compromise:**

    * **Senate:** Each state would have equal representation (2 senators per state).
    * **House of Representatives:** Representation would be based on the population of each state. 

## Impact? Why Significant?: 
* **Saved the Convention:** The [Great Compromise](./../great-compromise/) resolved a major deadlock that threatened the entire [Constitutional Convention](./../constitutional-convention/)|[Constitutional Convention](./../constitutional-convention/).
* **Shaped the U.S. Government:**  The bicameral legislature with its distinct features remains a cornerstone of the U.S. government today. 
* **Balance of Power:** It established a balance of power between larger and smaller states, ensuring that both had a voice in the federal government. This balance remains a key characteristic of American democracy. 
* **Legacy of Compromise:** The [Great Compromise](./../great-compromise/) demonstrated the importance of compromise in a democracy and set a precedent for resolving future conflicts through negotiation.
