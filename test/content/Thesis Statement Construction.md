**Definition:** A thesis statement is a concise summary of the main point or claim of an essay, research paper, or other written work.  It typically appears at the end of the introductory paragraph and acts as a roadmap for the entire piece.

**Key Components:**

* **Claim/Argument:**  The central assertion or argument you are making.  This is NOT a statement of fact, but a debatable opinion supported by evidence.
    * Example:  Instead of "Shakespeare wrote Hamlet,"  a thesis would be "Shakespeare's use of dramatic irony in *Hamlet* highlights the play's themes of betrayal and revenge."
* **Scope/Focus:** The specific area your essay will cover.  Avoid overly broad claims.
* **Roadmap/Structure:**  A brief indication of the main points or supporting arguments you will use to prove your claim.

**Types of Thesis Statements:**

* **Argumentative:** Presents a debatable claim and supports it with evidence.  This is the most common type.
* **Analytical:** Breaks down a subject into its component parts to examine how they relate to each other.
* **Expository:** Explains or informs the reader about a topic.  This often uses less of a clear argumentative stance.


**Formulating a Strong Thesis:**

[1](./../1/). **Identify your topic:** What are you writing about? [Topic Selection](./../topic-selection/)
[2](./../2/). **Develop a central claim:** What is your main argument or point about this topic?
[3](./../3/). **Refine your claim:** Is it specific enough? Is it debatable?  Avoid vague language.
[4](./../4/). **Outline supporting points:** What evidence will you use to support your claim?  [Evidence Gathering and Analysis](./../evidence-gathering-and-analysis/)
[5](./../5/). **Write your thesis:** Combine your claim and supporting points into a concise statement.


**Examples:**

* **Weak:**  "Pollution is bad." (Too broad, not debatable)
* **Strong:** "Air pollution in major cities contributes significantly to respiratory illnesses, necessitating stricter environmental regulations." (Specific, debatable, and indicates supporting points)


**Placement:**

The thesis statement usually appears at the end of the introductory paragraph, but it can sometimes be placed earlier, depending on the length and complexity of the paper.


**Revision:**

It's crucial to revise your thesis statement as you write.  Your initial thesis may need adjustments as your understanding of the topic develops.

**Formula (for argumentative thesis):**

 $  \text{Claim} + \text{Because} + \text{Reason [1](./../1/)} + \text{Reason [2](./../2/)} + \text{Reason [3](./../3/)}  $ 

##  $$  \text{Claim} + \text{Because} + \text{Reason [1](./../1/)}, \text{Reason [2](./../2/)}, \text{and Reason [3](./../3/)}  $$  

This formula provides a basic framework, but the structure will adapt depending on the complexity of your argument.
