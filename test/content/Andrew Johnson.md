# [POTUS](./../potus/)
# Andrew Johnson: A Contentious Presidency

Andrew Johnson (1808-1875) served as the 17th [POTUS](./../potus/) of the [United States](./../united-states/) from 1865 to 1869, following the [The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln](./../the-assassination-of-abraham-lincoln/). His presidency was largely defined by his clashes with Congress over [Reconstruction](./../reconstruction/) policies after the [Civil War](./../civil-war/), ultimately leading to his impeachment.

## Background

*   Born into poverty in Raleigh, North Carolina.
*   Self-educated and became a tailor.
*   Moved to Tennessee and entered politics, serving as a mayor, state legislator, U.S. Congressman, and U.S. Senator.
*   A Democrat who remained loyal to the Union during the Civil War, he was appointed military governor of Tennessee.
*   Chosen as [Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's](./../abraham-lincoln|lincolns/) Vice President in 1864 as a gesture of unity.

## Key Events and Policies

*   **Presidential Reconstruction (1865-1866):** [Andrew Johnson|Johnson](./../andrew-johnson|johnson/) implemented a lenient plan for Reconstruction, which aimed to quickly restore the Southern states to the Union. His plan included:
    *   Pardons to former Confederates who pledged allegiance to the Union.
    *   Required Southern states to ratify the [13th amendment](./../13th-amendment/), abolishing slavery.
    *   Allowed Southern states to establish new governments with limited federal oversight.
    *   This plan was viewed by many in the north as being too lenient, and many states took advantage of the loose regulation to implement things such as [Black Codes](./../black-codes/) that curtailed the freedoms of African-Americans.

*   **Vetoes of Congressional Reconstruction Legislation:** [Andrew Johnson|Johnson](./../andrew-johnson|johnson/) repeatedly vetoed legislation passed by the [Radical Republicans](./../radical-republicans/) in Congress that aimed to protect the rights of freedmen and punish the South, including:
    *   [Freedmans Bureau|Extension of the Freedmen's Bureau](./../freedmans-bureau|extension-of-the-freedmens-bureau/): The Freedmen's Bureau was designed to aid former slaves in the South.
    *   [Civil Rights Act of 1866](./../civil-rights-act-of-1866/): Granted citizenship to all persons born in the [United States](./../united-states/) (excluding Native Americans) and prohibited discrimination based on race.

*   **Clash with Congress:** Johnson's vetoes and his opposition to Congressional Reconstruction policies led to a bitter power struggle with the [Radical Republicans](./../radical-republicans/) who controlled Congress.

*   **[Tenure of Office Act](./../tenure-of-office-act/) (1867):** Congress passed this act to restrict the president's power to remove cabinet members without Senate approval, aiming to protect Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a [Radical Republicans|Radical Republican](./../radical-republicans|radical-republican/) and Johnson critic.

*   **Impeachment (1868):** [Andrew Johnson|Johnson](./../andrew-johnson|johnson/) violated the [Tenure of Office Act](./../tenure-of-office-act/) by firing Edwin Stanton. The House of Representatives impeached him for "high crimes and misdemeanors." He was tried by the Senate and acquitted by one vote, avoiding removal from office.

*   **Purchase of Alaska (1867):** Secretary of State William Seward negotiated the purchase of [Alaska](./../alaska/) from Russia for  $ 7.2 million.  Often ridiculed as "Seward's Folly," the acquisition later proved to be a valuable resource.

## Important Legislation Signed (Limited)

*   Little significant legislation was signed due to Johnson's conflicts with Congress. The most notable was the [Alaska](./../alaska/) purchase treaty.

## Groups and Affiliations

*   [Democrats](./../democrats/): Johnson was a lifelong Democrat.
*   National Union Party: A short-lived coalition party during the 1864 election, aimed at uniting Republicans and War Democrats.

## Impact on the Country

*   **Delayed Reconstruction:** His opposition to Congressional Reconstruction prolonged the process of rebuilding the South and integrating freedmen into society.
*   **Increased Racial Tensions:** His lenient policies towards the South and his vetoes of civil rights legislation emboldened white Southerners and contributed to the rise of [Jim Crow Laws](./../jim-crow-laws/).
*   **Weakened Presidency:** The impeachment proceedings weakened the office of the president and established limits on executive power in relation to Congress.
*   **Solidified Republican Control:** Johnson's actions helped to solidify the [Republicans|Republican](./../republicans|republican/) Party's control over Congress and the nation for several years.
