## ID: [Boston Tea Party](./../boston-tea-party/) 
## When: December 16, 1773

## Who:
* **[Sons of Liberty](./../sons-of-liberty/):**  A group of American colonists who organized and participated in the event.  Key figures included [Samuel Adams](./../samuel-adams/), but many others participated.
* **British East India Company:** The target of the protest, whose tea monopoly was the issue.
* **British Authorities:**  Initially, they were largely passive observers though later responded with the [Intolerable Acts](./../intolerable-acts/).


## What:
A political protest by the [Sons of Liberty](./../sons-of-liberty/) in Boston, [Massachusetts](./../massachusetts/), where colonists disguised as Mohawk Indians boarded three British ships and dumped 342 chests of tea into Boston Harbor to protest the [Tea Act](./../tea-act/).

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Escalation of Tensions:** The [Boston Tea Party](./../boston-tea-party/) significantly escalated tensions between [Great Britain](./../great-britain/) and the American colonies. It was a bold act of defiance that directly challenged British authority.
* **[Intolerable Acts](./../intolerable-acts/):** The British government responded with the [Intolerable Acts](./../intolerable-acts/) (also known as the Coercive Acts), a series of punitive measures designed to punish [Massachusetts](./../massachusetts/) and assert British control.  These acts further inflamed colonial resentment.
* **Movement Towards Revolution:** The event marked a crucial step toward the American Revolution. It demonstrated the growing colonial resistance to British policies and contributed to the growing sentiment for independence.
* **Propaganda and Symbolism:** The [Boston Tea Party](./../boston-tea-party/) became a powerful symbol of colonial resistance and was widely publicized throughout the colonies, fostering unity among the colonists.
* **Taxation Without Representation:** The event highlighted the colonists' central grievance: taxation without representation. The [Tea Act](./../tea-act/), while seemingly beneficial on the surface, was viewed as an attempt to undermine colonial merchants and force acceptance of taxation without colonial consent.
