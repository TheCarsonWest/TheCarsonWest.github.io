This note covers methods and considerations for comparative analysis.

**I. Types of [Comparative Analysis](./../comparative-analysis/):**

* **Qualitative [Comparative Analysis](./../comparative-analysis/) (QCA):**  Useful for exploring causal relationships in small-N cases.  Focuses on configurations of conditions leading to outcomes.  [QCA Methods](./../qca-methods/)
* **Quantitative [Comparative Analysis](./../comparative-analysis/):** Uses statistical methods to compare groups or variables across multiple cases.  Allows for broader generalizations but may require larger datasets and strong assumptions. [Statistical Methods in Comparative Analysis](./../statistical-methods-in-comparative-analysis/)
* **Most Similar Systems Design (MSSD):** Compares similar cases to isolate the impact of a specific variable.  Helps control for confounding factors. [MSSD Example](./../mssd-example/)
* **Most Different Systems Design (MDSD):** Compares dissimilar cases that share a common outcome to identify necessary conditions.  Helps establish causal mechanisms. [MDSD Example](./../mdsd-example/)
* **Within-Case Comparison:** Examining different aspects or periods within a single case to understand causal processes. [Within-Case Analysis](./../within-case-analysis/)

**II. Key Considerations:**

* **Case Selection:**  Crucial for the validity of comparative analysis.  Bias can be introduced through selective inclusion or exclusion of cases.  Consider using strategies like MSSD or MDSD to mitigate bias. [Case Selection Bias](./../case-selection-bias/)
* **Variable Measurement:**  Standardizing measurement across cases is critical for accurate comparisons.  Consider using comparable indicators and controlling for measurement error. [Measurement Issues](./../measurement-issues/)
* **Causal Inference:**  Establishing causality requires careful consideration of potential confounding factors and alternative explanations.  Use of statistical controls or process tracing can strengthen causal inferences. [Causal Inference in Comparative Research](./../causal-inference-in-comparative-research/)
* **Generalizability:** The extent to which findings can be generalized depends on the representativeness of the selected cases.  Consider limitations of small-N studies. [Generalizability and External Validity](./../generalizability-and-external-validity/)


**III.  Statistical Techniques (Linked to [Statistical Methods in Comparative Analysis](./../statistical-methods-in-comparative-analysis/)):**

* **Regression Analysis:**   $ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \dots + \epsilon $   where  $ Y $  is the dependent variable and  $ X_i $  are independent variables.
* **t-tests:** Used to compare the means of two groups.
* **ANOVA:** Used to compare the means of three or more groups.
* **Chi-squared test:** Used to test for association between categorical variables.


**IV.  Data Sources:**

*  Primary Data: [Primary Data Collection](./../primary-data-collection/)
*  Secondary Data: [Secondary Data Sources](./../secondary-data-sources/)


**V.  Example Comparative Research Questions:**

* What are the factors contributing to economic growth in different countries?
* How do different political systems impact levels of social inequality?
* What are the causes of civil war?


This is a starting point for my comparative analysis notes.  I'll add more detail to each sub-section as needed.
