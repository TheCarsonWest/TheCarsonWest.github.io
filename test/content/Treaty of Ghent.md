## WHEN: December 24, 1814

## WHO: 
* **[United States](./../united-states/)** represented by [John Quincy Adams](./../john-quincy-adams/), Henry Clay, and Albert Gallatin.

## IMPACT? Why Significant?: 
* **Return to Status Quo Ante Bellum:**  The treaty essentially restored pre-war boundaries and did not address the original causes of the conflict, such as impressment or neutral trading rights.
* **Preserved American Independence:** Despite not achieving all of its war aims, the treaty solidified the [United States](./../united-states/)' independence and prevented British attempts to reclaim territory. 
* **Fueled Nationalism:** The war's outcome, despite the treaty's terms, fostered a sense of American national pride and unity, contributing to the [Era of Good Feelings](./../era-of-good-feelings/). 
* **Shifted Focus Westward:** With the British threat in the east diminished, the [United States](./../united-states/) was free to expand westward, leading to increased conflict with Native American tribes.
