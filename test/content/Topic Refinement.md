**Goal:**  Refine the topic "[Topic Refinement](./../topic-refinement/)" into a manageable and researchable scope.

**Current Status:**  Too broad.  Needs significant narrowing.

**Possible Refinement Approaches:**

[1](./../1/). **Focus on a specific methodology:**
    * [Topic Refinement](./../topic-refinement/) Methodologies]]  (This will be a separate note)
    *  Examples:  Keyword analysis, mind mapping, literature review, stakeholder interviews.  Consider focusing on *one* specific methodology.

[2](./../2/). **Focus on a specific application area:**
    * [Topic Refinement](./../topic-refinement/) in Scientific Research]] (This will be a separate note)
    * [Topic Refinement](./../topic-refinement/) in Project Management]] (This will be a separate note)
    * [Topic Refinement](./../topic-refinement/) in Marketing]] (This will be a separate note)
    * Choosing a specific field will provide a more concrete context.


[3](./../3/). **Focus on a specific problem related to topic refinement:**
    * For example,  the problem of identifying biases in topic selection, or overcoming writer's block during the refinement process.
    * [Bias in Topic Selection](./../bias-in-topic-selection/) (This will be a separate note)
    * [[Overcoming Writer's Block in [Topic Refinement](./../topic-refinement/) (This will be a separate note)


[4](./../4/). **Consider the scope of the research:**
    * Will this be a short, focused piece, or a long, in-depth analysis?  This will significantly influence the level of refinement needed.
    * [Scope and Depth of Research](./../scope-and-depth-of-research/) (This will be a separate note)


**Evaluation Metrics:**

* **Specificity:**  How precisely is the topic defined?
* **Feasibility:**  Is it possible to research this topic within the available resources (time, data, etc.)?
* **Relevance:**  Is the topic relevant to the intended audience and purpose?
* **Interest:**  Is the topic engaging and likely to produce insightful results?


**Mathematical Modeling (If applicable):**

While not directly applicable to all refinement approaches, some aspects might benefit from a quantitative analysis.  For instance, if using keyword analysis, we might use metrics like:

* **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF):**  $ TF-IDF(t,d) = TF(t,d) \times IDF(t) $ 
* **Keyword density:**  $ Keyword \; Density = \frac{Number \; of \; Keywords}{Total \; Number \; of \; Words} $ 


Further refinement will require choosing ONE of the above approaches and further developing the chosen direction.  This may require iterative refinement of the topic itself.


**Next Steps:**

[1](./../1/). Choose ONE refinement approach from the list above.
[2](./../2/). Create a detailed outline for the chosen approach, referencing other relevant notes (created from the list above).
[3](./../3/). Begin literature review and research.
