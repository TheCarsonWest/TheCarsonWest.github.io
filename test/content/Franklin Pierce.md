# [POTUS](./../potus/)
# Franklin Pierce: A Rundown
Franklin Pierce (1804-1869) was the 14th [POTUS](./../potus/), serving from 1853 to 1857. His presidency was largely overshadowed by the growing [sectionalism](./../sectionalism/) in the [United States](./../united-states/) leading up to the [Civil War](./../civil-war/).
 

 ## Key Events and Associations:
 

 *   **Early Life and Career:**
  *   Born in [New Hampshire](./../new-hampshire/), Pierce came from a prominent political family.
  *   Graduated from Bowdoin College.
  *   Served in the [New Hampshire](./../new-hampshire/) state legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives.
  *   Served as a U.S. Senator.
  *   Resigned from the Senate to focus on his family and law practice.
  *   Served as a brigadier general in the Mexican-American War, though his military record was mixed.
 *   **Election of 1852:**
  *   Pierce was a "dark horse" candidate nominated by the [Democrats](./../democrats/) after multiple ballots.
  *   He benefited from being seen as a compromise candidate acceptable to both Northern and Southern factions of the party.
  *   He won a landslide victory against [William McKinley](./../william-mckinley/).
 *   **The [Kansas-Nebraska Act](./../kansas-nebraska-act/) (1854):**
  *   This act, supported by Pierce, repealed the [Missouri Compromise](./../missouri-compromise/) and allowed for [Popular Sovereignty](./../popular-sovereignty/) in the territories of Kansas and [Nebraska](./../nebraska/).
  *   It led to widespread violence in Kansas ("[Bleeding Kansas](./../bleeding-kansas/)") and further inflamed sectional tensions.
 *   **Gadsden Purchase (1853):**
  *   Pierce authorized the purchase of a strip of land from Mexico for  $ 10 million.
  *   This land was intended to facilitate the construction of a transcontinental railroad along a southern route.
 *   **Ostend Manifesto (1854):**
  *   This document, drafted by U.S. diplomats in Europe, suggested that the [United States](./../united-states/) should seize [Cuba](./../cuba/) from [Spain](./../spain/) if [Spain](./../spain/) refused to sell it.
  *   The manifesto was controversial and further fueled concerns about the expansion of slavery.
 *   **"Young America" Movement:**
  *   Pierce was sympathetic to this movement, which advocated for U.S. expansion and influence abroad.
  *   It reflected a belief in American exceptionalism and a desire to spread democracy.
 

 ## Important Legislation Signed:
 

 *   **[Kansas-Nebraska Act](./../kansas-nebraska-act/) (1854)** (As mentioned above)
 *   **Gadsden Purchase Treaty (1853)**
 

 ## Groups and Affiliations:
 

 *   **[Democrats](./../democrats/):** Pierce was a staunch member of the [Democrats](./../democrats/) and believed in states' rights and limited federal government.
 

 ## Impact on the Country:
 

 *   **Negative Impact on Sectional Tensions:** Pierce's support for the [Kansas-Nebraska Act](./../kansas-nebraska-act/) is widely considered a major factor in escalating the conflict between the North and South. His actions deepened the divide over slavery and pushed the nation closer to [Civil War](./../civil-war/).
 *   **Weakening of the [Democrats](./../democrats/):** The controversy surrounding the [Kansas-Nebraska Act](./../kansas-nebraska-act/) split the [Democrats](./../democrats/) and weakened their ability to govern effectively.
 *   **Rise of the [New Republican Party 1850|Republican Party](./../new-republican-party-1850|republican-party/):** The furor over the [Kansas-Nebraska Act](./../kansas-nebraska-act/) led to the formation of the [New Republican Party 1850](./../new-republican-party-1850/), which opposed the expansion of slavery.
 *   **Foreign Policy Controversies:** The [Ostend Manifesto](./../ostend-manifesto/) damaged the credibility of the [United States](./../united-states/) on the international stage and raised concerns about American imperialism.
 

 In conclusion, [Franklin Pierce](./../franklin-pierce/)'s presidency is generally viewed as a failure due to his handling of the slavery issue and its contribution to the growing [sectionalism](./../sectionalism/) that led to the [Civil War](./../civil-war/).
