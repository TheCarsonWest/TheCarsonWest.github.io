This section covers calculations involving equilibrium constants ( $ K $ ).  We'll break it down by type of equilibrium.

**1.  $ K_c $  ([Equilibrium](./../equilibrium/) Constant in terms of concentration):**

*   **Definition:**  $ K_c = \frac{[Products]}{[Reactants]} $   where the bracketed terms represent the equilibrium concentrations raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients.
*   **Example:** For the reaction  $ aA + bB \rightleftharpoons cC + dD $ ,   $ K_c = \frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b} $ 
*   **[ICE Tables:**  Use ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium](./../ice-tables:**--use-ice-(initial-change-equilibrium/)) tables to organize information and solve for equilibrium concentrations when some are known.  (ICE Table Examples]]]])
*   **Calculations:** Often involve solving quadratic or cubic equations.  Approximations can be made if  $ K $  is very small or very large. ([Approximation Techniques](./../approximation-techniques/))
*   **Units:**  $ K_c $  has units that depend on the stoichiometry of the reaction.  Usually omitted for simplicity.

**2.  $ K_p $  ([Equilibrium](./../equilibrium/) Constant in terms of partial pressures):**

*   **Definition:**  Similar to  $ K_c $ , but uses partial pressures of gases instead of concentrations.  $ K_p = \frac{P_{products}}{P_{reactants}} $ 
*   **Relationship to  $ K_c $ :**  $ K_p = K_c(RT)^{\Delta n} $ , where R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and  $ \Delta n $  is the change in the number of moles of gas (moles of gaseous products - moles of gaseous reactants). [K_p and K_c Relationship](./../k_p-and-k_c-relationship/)
*   **Calculations:**  Similar to  $ K_c $  calculations, but using partial pressures.


**3.   $ K_w $  (Ion-Product Constant for Water):**

*   **Definition:**  $ K_w = [H_3O^+][OH^-] = 1.0 \times 10^{-14} $  at 25°C.  ([Water Autoionization](./../water-autoionization/))
*   **pH and pOH:** Related to  $ K_w $  by:  $ pH + pOH = 14 $  at 25°C.  ([pH and pOH Calculations](./../ph-and-poh-calculations/))


**4. Heterogeneous Equilibria:**

*   **Definition:** Equilibria involving reactants and products in different phases (e.g., solids, liquids, gases).
*   ** $ K $  expression:** Pure solids and liquids are excluded from the  $ K $  expression because their concentrations are essentially constant. [Heterogeneous Equilibria Examples](./../heterogeneous-equilibria-examples/)


**5. Calculating [Equilibrium](./../equilibrium/) Concentrations:**

*   Often requires solving equilibrium expressions which can range from simple algebraic equations to more complex systems requiring numerical methods. [Solving Equilibrium Expressions](./../solving-equilibrium-expressions/)
