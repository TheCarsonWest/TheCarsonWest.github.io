## ID: [Wagner Act](./../wagner-act/)

## When: July 5, 1935

## Who:
*   Sponsored by Senator Robert F. Wagner of [New York](./../new-york/).
*   Passed by the U.S. Congress.
*   Signed into law by President [Franklin D. Roosevelt](./../franklin-d.-roosevelt/).
*   Impacted both employers and employees in the private sector.

## What:

*   Formally known as the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).
*   Established the legal right of most workers (excluding agricultural and domestic workers) to organize unions, bargain collectively with employers, and engage in strikes and other forms of concerted activity in support of their demands.
*   Created the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to enforce the Act, conduct elections for union representation, and investigate and remedy unfair labor practices by employers.
*   Outlawed company unions and blacklisting of union members.
*   Defined and prohibited specific unfair labor practices by employers, such as interfering with union organizing, discriminating against union members, and refusing to bargain in good faith.

## Impact: Why Significant?:
*   **Empowered [Labor Unions](./../labor-unions/):** Significantly strengthened the labor movement in the [United States](./../united-states/). Union membership surged following the passage of the [Wagner Act](./../wagner-act/).
*   **Collective Bargaining:** Promoted collective bargaining as a means of resolving labor disputes and improving working conditions.
*   **Improved Wages and Working Conditions:** Contributed to higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions for unionized workers.
*   **Increased Labor Disputes:** The rise of unions and collective bargaining also led to increased labor disputes and strikes in some industries.
*   **Shift in Power:** Shifted the balance of power between employers and employees, giving workers a greater voice in the workplace.
*   **Foundation for Future Labor Law:** Established the foundation for much of modern U.S. labor law.  Remains a cornerstone of labor relations in the [United States](./../united-states/), albeit with significant amendments over time (such as the [Taft-Hartley Act](./../taft-hartley-act/) of 1947).
