## Introduction to Solutions
A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. The substance present in the largest amount is called the **solvent**, and the other substance(s) are called **solute(s)**.  Solutions can exist in various phases (solid, liquid, or gas), but in AP Chemistry, we primarily focus on aqueous solutions, where the solvent is water.
