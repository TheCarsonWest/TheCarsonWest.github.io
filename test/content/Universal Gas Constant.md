#### The gas constant is a constant, represented by R, that is used in the [Ideal Gas Laws](./../ideal-gas-laws/) equations
# For equations using Kilopascals(kPa):  $$  R = 8.314 \text{ kPa L mol}^{-[[1}\text{ K}^{-[[1} $$  # For equations using Atmospheres(atm):
#  $$  R = 0.08206 \text{ atm L mol}^{-[[1}\text{ K}^{-[[1} $$
