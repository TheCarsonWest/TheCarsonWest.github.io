**Goal:** Understand and implement strategies for ensuring data accuracy and verifying its integrity.


**Key Aspects:**

* **Data Sources:** [Data Source Evaluation](./../data-source-evaluation/)  -  Identify potential biases and inaccuracies inherent in different data sources (e.g., surveys, sensors, databases).  Consider factors like sampling methods, measurement errors, and data collection procedures.
* **Data Cleaning:** [Data Cleaning Techniques](./../data-cleaning-techniques/) - Techniques to handle missing values ( $$  \text{Missing Data Percentage} = \frac{\text{Number of Missing Values}}{\text{Total Number of Values}} \times 100  $$ ), outliers ( $$  \text{Outlier Detection using IQR: } \text{Upper Bound} = Q_3 + [[1.5 \times IQR; \text{Lower Bound} = Q_1 - [[1.5 \times IQR  $$ ), and inconsistencies. This might involve imputation, smoothing, or removal of problematic data points.
* **Data Validation:** [Data Validation Rules](./../data-validation-rules/) - Define rules and constraints to ensure data conforms to expected formats and ranges.  Examples include:
    * **Range checks:**   $ x \ge 0 $   for a variable representing age.
    * **Format checks:** Ensuring date fields adhere to YYYY-MM-DD format.
    * **Consistency checks:** Verifying that related fields are logically consistent (e.g., birth date < current date).
* **Data Verification:** [Verification Methods](./../verification-methods/) - Employ techniques to confirm the accuracy of data after cleaning and validation.  This could include:
    * **Cross-referencing:** Comparing data with other sources to identify discrepancies.
    * **Reconciliation:** Matching data from different systems or processes.
    * **Auditing:**  Formal review of data collection, processing, and storage procedures.
* **Data Quality Metrics:** [Data Quality Metrics](./../data-quality-metrics/) - Quantify data accuracy using metrics such as:
    * **Accuracy:** The ratio of correctly classified instances to the total number of instances.
    * **Completeness:** The percentage of non-missing values.
    * **Consistency:** The degree to which data conforms to predefined rules and constraints.
* **[Error Handling](./../error-handling/):** [Error Handling Strategies](./../error-handling-strategies/)  - Develop procedures for identifying, reporting, and correcting data errors. Establish a process for tracking and resolving data quality issues.  A workflow diagram might be helpful here.
