# ID: [Monroe Doctrine](./../monroe-doctrine/) 
## When: December 2, 1823

## Who: 
- **President [James Monroe](./../james-monroe/)** (The doctrine was written by Secretary of State [John Quincy Adams](./../john-quincy-adams/), but it was part of Monroe's annual message to Congress)

## What: 
A foreign policy statement declaring that:

[1. **The Americas were closed to further European colonization.**  Any attempts to colonize or interfere in the Western Hemisphere by European powers would be considered a hostile act against the [[United States](./../1.-**the-americas-were-closed-to-further-european-colonization.**--any-attempts-to-colonize-or-interfere-in-the-western-hemisphere-by-european-powers-would-be-considered-a-hostile-act-against-the-[[united-states/).
2. **The [United States](./../united-states/) would not interfere in the internal affairs of European nations** or their existing colonies. 
3. **The [United States](./../united-states/) recognized and would not interfere with existing colonies in the Western Hemisphere.**

## Impact? Why Significant?: 

* **Established the U.S. as a dominant power in the Western Hemisphere.** 
* **Asserted American neutrality in European conflicts,** signaling a departure from its previous involvement in European affairs.
* **Laid the groundwork for future U.S. interventionism in Latin America.** While initially about protecting the Americas from Europe, the [Monroe Doctrine](./../monroe-doctrine/) would later be used to justify U.S. interventions in Latin American countries.
* **Had little impact at the time** as the U.S. lacked the military strength to enforce it. Its significance grew later in the 19th century as the U.S. became a stronger nation. 
* **Remains a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy today**, though its interpretation and application have evolved over time.
