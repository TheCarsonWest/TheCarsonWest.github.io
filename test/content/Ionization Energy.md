- ## Ionization energy is the amount of energy required to remove an electron from an atom
- Can be predicted with [Coulombs Law](./../coulombs-law/)
- Shown through [Photoelectron Spectroscopy](./../photoelectron-spectroscopy/)
- The **more electrons** an atom has, the **less attracted** they are to an individual electron
- If it has a **positive charge**, it **wants to get rid of that electron** to be made whole
- **Electrons closer to the nucleus experience greater attraction force**
- We mostly just look at the first ionization energy, but **there are tables showing the ionization energies of every electron an atom can hold**
	- These are called **Successive [Ionization Energy](./../ionization-energy/) Tables**
