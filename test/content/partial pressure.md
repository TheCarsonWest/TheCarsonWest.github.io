# Very simple equation

#  $$ P_{t}=\sum P_{n} $$  ### Or for dummies:
  $$ P_{t} = P_{[1](./../1/)}+P_{[2](./../2/)}+\ ...\ + P_{n} $$  # To find one element's [partial pressure](./../partial-pressure/)
#  $$ P_A = x_A P_A^* $$  where:

*  $ P_A $  is the [partial pressure](./../partial-pressure/) of component A
*  $ x_A $  is the mole fraction of component A in the liquid phase
*  $ P_A^* $  is the [vapor pressure](./../vapor-pressure/) of pure component A
