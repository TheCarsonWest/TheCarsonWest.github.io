## ID: [Omaha Platform](./../omaha-platform/)

## When: July [4](./../4/), 1892

## Who:
* **[Populist Party](./../populist-party/):**  The platform was drafted and adopted by the People's Party ([Populists](./../populists/)) at their national convention in Omaha, [Nebraska](./../nebraska/).  Key figures included Ignatius Donnelly, Mary Elizabeth Lease, and James B. Weaver.

## What: 
The [Omaha Platform](./../omaha-platform/) was the political platform of the [Populist Party](./../populist-party/), outlining their goals and demands for economic and political reform. It addressed issues like unfair economic practices, political corruption, and the plight of farmers and laborers.  Key planks included:

* **Free coinage of silver:**  Advocated for expanding the money supply by minting silver alongside gold, believing it would boost prices and ease farmers' debt burdens.
* **Graduated income tax:**  A progressive tax system where higher earners pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes.
* **Government ownership of railroads, telegraphs, and telephones:**  To curb monopolies and ensure fair prices and access.
* **Direct election of Senators:** To make the Senate more responsive to the will of the people.
* **Eight-hour workday:**  To improve working conditions for laborers.
* **Immigration restriction:** (Note: This element is often overlooked but present in the platform; reflects some of the more nativist undercurrents of the Populist movement)

## Impact: Why Significant?:

* **Third-party influence:** The [Omaha Platform](./../omaha-platform/) demonstrated the growing power of third-party movements in challenging the established two-party system ([Democrats](./../democrats/) and [Republicans](./../republicans/)).
* **Progressive movement precursor:**  Many of the [Populists](./../populists/)' demands—like the income tax and direct election of senators—were later adopted by the Progressive movement in the early 20th century.
* **Focus on economic inequality:** The platform highlighted the growing chasm between wealthy industrialists and the working class, farmers, and laborers.
* **Increased farmer political engagement:**  The platform mobilized farmers and agricultural workers, resulting in increased political participation and advocacy for their concerns.
* **Limited electoral success (initially):** While the [Populist Party](./../populist-party/) failed to win the presidency, the [Omaha Platform](./../omaha-platform/) significantly influenced the political discourse of the time and laid the groundwork for future reform efforts.  The party's influence would wane, but many of its ideas gained wider acceptance.
