**I. Evaluating Evidence:**

* **Credibility:**  Consider the source's expertise, reputation, potential biases, and publication process.  Is it a peer-reviewed journal? A reputable news source? A government report? Or a blog post?  [Source Credibility](./../source-credibility/)

* **Relevance:** Does the evidence directly support the claim being made?  Is it applicable to the context?  [Relevance & Applicability](./../relevance-&-applicability/)

* **Accuracy:** Is the information factual and free from errors? Are the data and statistics correctly presented and interpreted? Are there any conflicting sources that need to be considered? [Data Accuracy & Verification](./../data-accuracy-&-verification/)

* **Completeness:** Does the evidence provide a comprehensive picture of the issue? Are there any missing pieces of the puzzle? Are there any counterarguments that should be considered? [Completeness and Counterarguments](./../completeness-and-counterarguments/)

* **Sufficiency:** Is there enough evidence to support the claim?   $ n \ge 30 $  for statistical significance (in many cases). [Statistical Significance](./../statistical-significance/)


* **Timeliness:** Is the evidence current and up-to-date?  Outdated information may not be relevant. [Timeliness of Evidence](./../timeliness-of-evidence/)


**II. [Citation Styles](./../citation-styles/):**

Different fields and publications require different citation styles.  Consistency is key.

* **MLA:** Commonly used in humanities.  Example: (Author's Last Name Page Number). [MLA Citation Style](./../mla-citation-style/)
* **APA:** Commonly used in social sciences.  Example: (Author's Last Name, Year, Page Number). [APA Citation Style](./../apa-citation-style/)
* **Chicago:**  Multiple styles within Chicago (Notes & Bibliography, Author-Date).  [Chicago Citation Style](./../chicago-citation-style/)


**III. [Avoiding Plagiarism](./../avoiding-plagiarism/):**

Proper citation is crucial to avoid plagiarism.  Always cite your sources, even if paraphrasing.  Direct quotes must be enclosed in quotation marks.  [Avoiding Plagiarism](./../avoiding-plagiarism/)


**IV.  [Common Fallacies](./../common-fallacies/) in Reasoning:**

Understanding common fallacies is crucial for critically evaluating evidence. 
* **Ad hominem:** Attacking the person making the argument instead of the argument itself.
* **Appeal to authority:**  Accepting an argument solely because an authority figure claims it to be true.
* **Bandwagon fallacy:**  Assuming something is true because it is popular.
* **Straw man fallacy:**  Misrepresenting an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack.  [Logical Fallacies](./../logical-fallacies/)


**V.  Types of Evidence:**

* **Quantitative Data:** Numerical data (e.g., statistics, measurements). [Quantitative Evidence](./../quantitative-evidence/)
* **Qualitative Data:** Non-numerical data (e.g., interviews, observations). [Qualitative Evidence](./../qualitative-evidence/)
* **Anecdotal Evidence:** Personal stories or observations.  Generally considered weak evidence on its own.


**VI.  Building a Strong Argument:**

* Clearly state your thesis.
* Present evidence to support your claims.
* Address counterarguments.
* Conclude with a summary of your findings. [Constructing an Argument](./../constructing-an-argument/)


**VII. Tools for Citation Management:**

* Zotero
* Mendeley
* EndNote  [Citation Management Software](./../citation-management-software/)
