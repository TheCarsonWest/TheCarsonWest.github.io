This note covers verb conjugation and tense usage in English.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Verb:** A word that describes an action, state, or occurrence.  Example: *run*, *is*, *become*.
* **Tense:**  A grammatical category that expresses the time of an action or state of being.


**Main Tenses:**

* **Present Tense:** Describes actions happening now.
    * Simple Present:  I  $ walk $  to school every day.
    * Present Continuous: I  $ am $   $ walking $  to school right now.
    * Present Perfect: I  $ have $   $ walked $  to school many times.
    * Present Perfect Continuous: I  $ have $   $ been $   $ walking $  for an hour.
* **Past Tense:** Describes actions that happened before now.
    * Simple Past: I  $ walked $  to school yesterday.
    * Past Continuous: I  $ was $   $ walking $  to school when it started to rain.
    * Past Perfect: I  $ had $   $ walked $  to school before the bus strike.
    * Past Perfect Continuous: I  $ had $   $ been $   $ walking $  for an hour before I arrived.
* **Future Tense:** Describes actions that will happen in the future.
    * Simple Future: I  $ will $   $ walk $  to school tomorrow.
    * Future Continuous: I  $ will $   $ be $   $ walking $  to school at this time tomorrow.

**Irregular Verbs:** [Irregular Verbs List](./../irregular-verbs-list/)  These verbs don't follow regular past tense and past participle patterns (e.g., *go*, *went*, *gone*).


**Aspect:**  This grammatical category expresses the way an action unfolds over time (e.g., completion, duration, repetition).  We see this expressed by the different forms of the perfect and continuous tenses.  [Aspects of Verbs](./../aspects-of-verbs/)


**Mood:**  This grammatical category expresses the speaker's attitude towards the action (e.g., indicative, imperative, subjunctive). [Verb Moods](./../verb-moods/)


**Voice:**  This grammatical category indicates whether the subject performs the action (active voice) or receives the action (passive voice).  [Active and Passive Voice](./../active-and-passive-voice/)


**Examples of Tense Usage:**

* **Simple Present:**  The cat sits on the mat.
* **Present Continuous:** The cat is sitting on the mat.
