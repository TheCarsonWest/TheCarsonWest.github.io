    * **Slang:**  Very informal language, often specific to a particular group or time period.  Example: "That's bogus!"
    * **Colloquial:** Informal language used in everyday conversation. Example: "Gonna", "wanna"
    * **Technical:**  Specialized vocabulary related to a particular field.  Example:  "The algorithm converged after 10 iterations."
    * **Archaic:**  Words or phrases no longer in common use. Example: "Hark!"
