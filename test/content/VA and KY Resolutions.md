**Notecard: [VA and KY Resolutions](./../va-and-ky-resolutions/)**

**WHEN:** December 1825 - February 1833

**WHO:**

* **[Virginia](./../virginia/) Assembly:** Led by [James Madison](./../james-madison/)
* **[Kentucky](./../kentucky/) Legislature:** Led by Henry Clay

**WHAT:**

* **Resolutions:** State legislative declarations protesting the federal Tariff of 1828, which Southern states saw as unfair.
* **Arguments:** Claimed the tariff was unconstitutional (KY Resolution) and violated states' rights (VA Resolution).
* **Threatened:** Nullification (refusal to enforce the law within state borders) if the tariff was not repealed.

**IMPACT:**

* **Nullification Crisis:** Sparked a major constitutional debate and led to President [Andrew Jackson](./../andrew-jackson/)'s defense of federal authority.
* **Strengthened the Principle of States' Rights:** Affirmed the idea that states had some degree of independence from the federal government.
* **Precursor to the Civil War:** The nullification threat foreshadowed the later secession of Southern states over slavery.
