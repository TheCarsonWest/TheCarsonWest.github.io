# **[Enthalpy](./../enthalpy/) = ΔH**

[Enthalpy](./../enthalpy/) (H) is a thermodynamic state function representing the total heat content of a system at constant pressure.  The change in enthalpy (ΔH) during a reaction is the heat absorbed or released at constant pressure.  A negative ΔH indicates an [Exothermic](./../exothermic/) reaction (heat is released), while a positive ΔH indicates an endothermic reaction (heat is absorbed).  [Enthalpy](./../enthalpy/) changes are often determined experimentally using calorimetry.
