## WHEN: April 14, 1950

## WHO: 
*  Authored by the State Department and Defense Department under President Harry S. Truman. Key figures involved include Paul Nitze.

## WHAT: 

A top-secret National Security Council policy paper (NSC-68) presented to President Truman. It outlined a comprehensive strategic approach to combating the perceived threat of Soviet expansionism and communism globally. It advocated for a massive buildup of the US military, a stronger containment policy, and a more assertive role for the [United States](./../united-states/) in world affairs. The document framed the [Cold War](./../cold-war/) as a fundamental conflict between freedom and slavery. It called for a global commitment to containing Soviet influence.

## IMPACT: Why Significant?:
* **Militarization of Containment:** [NSC-68](./../nsc-68/) significantly shifted US foreign policy towards a more militaristic approach to containment. It advocated for a dramatic increase in military spending and the development of new weapons, including the hydrogen bomb.
* **Global Commitment:** It led to a broadened and more global understanding of containment, committing the [United States](./../united-states/) to intervening in various parts of the world to prevent the spread of communism.
* **Increased Defense Spending:** Directly resulted in a massive increase in the US defense budget, laying the foundation for the military-industrial complex Eisenhower would later warn against.
* **Korean War Justification:** The outbreak of the [Korean War](./../korean-war/) in June 1950 provided immediate justification for the policies outlined in [NSC-68](./../nsc-68/) and accelerated its implementation.
* **Cold War Escalation:** [NSC-68](./../nsc-68/) contributed to the escalation of the [Cold War](./../cold-war/) by solidifying the ideological divide and increasing the potential for military confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union.
* **Long-Term Foreign Policy:** [NSC-68](./../nsc-68/) shaped US foreign policy for decades to come, influencing interventions in Vietnam, Latin America, and other regions during the Cold War. It contributed to a globalized [Cold War](./../cold-war/) framework.
