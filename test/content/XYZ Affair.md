# ID: XYZ Affair
## When: 1797-1798
## Who: 
* **[United States](./../united-states/):** President [John Adams](./../john-adams/), Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, John Marshall, Elbridge Gerry (American diplomats)
* **[France](./../france/):**  Agents of French Foreign Minister Talleyrand (later nicknamed X, Y, and Z)

## What: 
Diplomatic incident where three low-level French agents (X, Y, and Z) demanded a bribe and a loan from American diplomats in exchange for negotiating a treaty to stop French attacks on American ships.  The Americans refused, leading to public outrage in the U.S.

## Impact? Why Significant?: 
* Fueled anti-French sentiment in the [United States](./../united-states/), leading to the Quasi-War, an undeclared naval conflict with [France](./../france/). 
* Increased support for the Federalist Party, who took a hard line against [France](./../france/).
* Contributed to the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts, which were aimed at suppressing dissent and limiting the power of the Democratic-Republican Party (seen as sympathetic to [France](./../france/)).
* Represented a significant challenge to the early American republic in terms of foreign policy and internal divisions.
