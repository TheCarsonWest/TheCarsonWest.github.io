The Brønsted-Lowry theory defines acids and bases based on the transfer of protons ( $ H^+ $ ).

* **Acid:** A species that donates a proton.
* **Base:** A species that accepts a proton.

**Key Concepts:**

* **[Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs](./../conjugate-acid-base-pairs/):**  An acid and its conjugate base differ by a single proton.  Similarly, a base and its conjugate acid differ by a single proton.  For example, in the reaction of  $ HCl $  with  $ H_2O $ :

    $ HCl(aq) + H_2O(l) \rightleftharpoons H_3O^+(aq) + Cl^-(aq) $ 

    $ HCl $  is the acid,  $ Cl^- $  is its conjugate base,  $ H_2O $  is the base, and  $ H_3O^+ $  is its conjugate acid.

* **[Amphoteric Substances](./../amphoteric-substances/):**  Substances that can act as both acids and bases.  Water is a classic example:

    $ H_2O(l) + H_2O(l) \rightleftharpoons H_3O^+(aq) + OH^-(aq) $ 

   In this autoionization of water, one water molecule acts as an acid (donating a proton), and the other acts as a base (accepting a proton).

* **Strong vs. Weak Acids/Bases:** This relates to the extent of proton donation/acceptance. Strong acids/bases completely dissociate in water, while weak acids/bases only partially dissociate.  [Acid and Base Strength](./../acid-and-base-strength/)

* ** $ K_a $  and  $ K_b $ :** The acid dissociation constant ( $ K_a $ ) and base dissociation constant ( $ K_b $ ) quantify the strength of weak acids and bases, respectively.  A larger  $ K_a $  or  $ K_b $  indicates a stronger acid or base. [Equilibrium Constants](./../equilibrium-constants/)

* **pH and pOH:**  These scales measure the acidity and basicity of a solution, respectively. They are related to the concentration of  $ H_3O^+ $  and  $ OH^- $  ions.   $ pH = -\log_{10}[H_3O^+]] $  and  $ pOH = -\log_{10}[OH^-]] $ . At 25°C,  $ pH + pOH = 14 $ . [pH and pOH Calculations](./../ph-and-poh-calculations/)

* **Titrations:**  Titrations are used to determine the concentration of an unknown acid or base by reacting it with a solution of known concentration. [Acid-Base Titrations](./../acid-base-titrations/)


**Example Reaction:**

The reaction between ammonia ( $ NH_3 $ ) and water:

##  $$ NH_3(aq) + H_2O(l) \rightleftharpoons NH_4^+(aq) + OH^-(aq) $$  
In this reaction,  $ NH_3 $  acts as a base (accepting a proton from water), and  $ H_2O $  acts as an acid (donating a proton).  $ NH_4^+ $  is the conjugate acid of  $ NH_3 $ , and  $ OH^- $  is the conjugate base of  $ H_2O $ .
