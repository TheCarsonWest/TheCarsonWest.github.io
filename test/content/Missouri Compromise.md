# ID: [Missouri](./../missouri/) Compromise]] 
## When: March 1820

## Who: 
* **Proposed by:** Henry Clay (Speaker of the House)
* **Key Figures:** 
    * **Pro-Compromise:** Henry Clay, Jesse B. Thomas
    * **Anti-Slavery:** James Tallmadge Jr. 
    * **Pro-Slavery:** John Taylor of Caroline

## What: 
A series of laws enacted by Congress to address the issue of slavery in new territories following [Missouri](./../missouri/)'s application for statehood as a slave state. The main components were:
* **[Missouri](./../missouri/) admitted as a slave state.**
* **[Maine](./../maine/) admitted as a free state** (previously part of [Massachusetts](./../massachusetts/)) to maintain balance in the Senate.
* **The 36°30′ parallel:** Slavery prohibited in the [Louisiana](./../louisiana/) Purchase]] territory north of this line, except for [Missouri](./../missouri/).

## Impact? Why Significant?: 
* **Temporary solution:** The Compromise temporarily defused the sectional crisis over slavery but ultimately failed to resolve the underlying tensions.
* **Precedent for  [sectionalism](./../sectionalism/) :** It established a pattern of sectional compromises that characterized the antebellum period. 
* **Strengthened abolitionist movement:**  The debate surrounding the compromise fueled the growth of the abolitionist movement in the North.
* **Foreshadowed future conflict:**  The [Missouri](./../missouri/) Compromise served as a precursor to the more significant crises over slavery that would culminate in the [Civil War](./../civil-war/).
