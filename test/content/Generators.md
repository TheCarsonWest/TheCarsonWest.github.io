# Generators 
## [Generators](./../generators/)

### What are [Generators](./../generators/)?
 [Generators](./../generators/) are a special type of function that returns a sequence of values one at a time, without storing the entire sequence in memory. They are created using the `yield` keyword instead of the `return` keyword.

### How to Use [Generators](./../generators/)
A generator function is defined like a regular function, except that it uses the `yield` keyword instead of `return` to produce values.

```python
def my_generator():
 for i in range(5):
 yield i
```

To use a generator, call it as you would a normal function. However, instead of returning a value, it will return a generator object. To iterate over the values generated by the generator, use a `for` loop.

```python
for i in my_generator():
 print(i)
```

### Code Examples
```python
# generator to generate even numbers
def gen_even():
 i = 0
 while True:
 yield i
 i += 2
```

```python
# use the generator to iterate over the first 10 even numbers
for number in gen_even():
 if number > 10:
 break
 print(number)
```

### Other Python Concepts Related to [Generators](./../generators/)

- [For Loops](./../for-loops/): [Generators](./../generators/) are commonly used in for loops to iterate over a sequence of values.
- [Yield](./../yield/): The `yield` keyword is used to create a generator function.
- [Return Values](./../return-values/): [Generators](./../generators/) return a `generator` object instead of a single value.
- [Functions](./../functions/): [Generators](./../generators/) are a type of function.
- [List Comprehension](./../list-comprehension/): [Generators](./../generators/) can be used as an alternative to list comprehensions for creating sequences.
