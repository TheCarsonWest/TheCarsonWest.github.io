## [7. Numerical Integration (Approximation Methods)](./../7.-numerical-integration-(approximation-methods)/) 
When an integral is difficult or impossible to solve analytically, numerical methods can be used to approximate its value.  Common methods include:

* **[Trapezoidal Rule](./../trapezoidal-rule/):** Approximates the area under the curve using trapezoids.
* **[Simpson's Rule](./../simpsons-rule/):** Approximates the area under the curve using parabolas.
