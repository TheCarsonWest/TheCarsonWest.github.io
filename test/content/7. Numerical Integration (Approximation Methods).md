## [[7. Numerical Integration (Approximation Methods)]] 
When an integral is difficult or impossible to solve analytically, numerical methods can be used to approximate its value.  Common methods include:

* **[[Trapezoidal Rule]]:** Approximates the area under the curve using trapezoids.
* **[[Simpson's Rule]]:** Approximates the area under the curve using parabolas.
