## ID: [2425/apush/ids/u6/Fourteen Points](./../2425/apush/ids/u6/fourteen-points/)

## When: January 8, 1919

## Who: President [Woodrow Wilson](./../woodrow-wilson/)

## What:  A speech delivered by President [Woodrow Wilson](./../woodrow-wilson/) to a joint session of Congress outlining his vision for a postwar world.  The [2425/apush/ids/u6/Fourteen Points](./../2425/apush/ids/u6/fourteen-points/) proposed a series of principles to prevent future wars, including open diplomacy, freedom of the seas, arms reductions, self-determination for nationalities, and the creation of a [2425/apush/ids/u6/League of Nations](./../2425/apush/ids/u6/league-of-nations/).

## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Post-WWI Peace Efforts:**  The [2425/apush/ids/u6/Fourteen Points](./../2425/apush/ids/u6/fourteen-points/) formed the basis for the Allied peace negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference. While not all points were fully adopted, they significantly influenced the [2425/apush/ids/u6/Treaty of Versailles](./../2425/apush/ids/u6/treaty-of-versailles/) and the creation of the [2425/apush/ids/u6/League of Nations](./../2425/apush/ids/u6/league-of-nations/).
* **Self-Determination:** The principle of self-determination for nationalities inspired nationalist movements around the world and influenced the redrawing of national boundaries in Europe.
* **[2425/apush/ids/u6/League of Nations](./../2425/apush/ids/u6/league-of-nations/):** The proposed [2425/apush/ids/u6/League of Nations](./../2425/apush/ids/u6/league-of-nations/), though ultimately flawed, represented a novel attempt at international cooperation and collective security, paving the way for future international organizations like the United Nations.
* **US Senate Rejection:**  The US Senate ultimately rejected the [2425/apush/ids/u6/Treaty of Versailles](./../2425/apush/ids/u6/treaty-of-versailles/) (including the [2425/apush/ids/u6/League of Nations](./../2425/apush/ids/u6/league-of-nations/)) due to concerns about American sovereignty and involvement in international affairs. This rejection significantly impacted the US's role in the post-war world and contributed to the rise of isolationism.
* **Idealism vs. Reality:** The [2425/apush/ids/u6/Fourteen Points](./../2425/apush/ids/u6/fourteen-points/) demonstrated Wilson's idealistic vision for a peaceful and just world order, but it also highlighted the difficulties in translating such ideals into practical policy in the face of competing national interests and power struggles.
