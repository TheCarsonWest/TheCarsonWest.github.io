# ID: [Kansas-Nebraska Act](./../kansas-nebraska-act/) 
## When: May 30, 1854
## Who: Stephen Douglas (Senator from [Illinois](./../illinois/)) 
## What: 
The [Kansas-Nebraska Act](./../kansas-nebraska-act/) was a controversial piece of legislation that allowed for the potential creation of two new states, [Kansas](./../kansas/) and [Nebraska](./../nebraska/), with the question of slavery to be determined by [popular sovereignty](./../popular-sovereignty/) (allowing the residents of each territory to vote on whether or not to allow slavery). 
## Impact: Why Significant?: 
This act effectively repealed the [Missouri Compromise](./../missouri-compromise/) of 1820 which prohibited slavery north of the 36°30′ parallel. This angered many in the North, leading to increased tensions between the North and South. It also sparked a violent struggle in [Kansas](./../kansas/), known as "[Bleeding Kansas](./../bleeding-kansas/)," as pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions clashed. The [Kansas-Nebraska Act](./../kansas-nebraska-act/) is seen as a major factor in the escalation of sectional tensions that ultimately led to the Civil War.
