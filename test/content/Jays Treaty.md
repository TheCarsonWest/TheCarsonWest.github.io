# ID: Jay's Treaty
## When: 
November 19, 1794 (ratified by the Senate June 24, 1795)

## Who: 
* **Negotiated by:** John Jay, Chief Justice of the [United States](./../united-states/) (sent by President [Washington](./../washington/))
* **Signed by:**  The [United States](./../united-states/) and [Great Britain](./../great-britain/)

## What: 
A treaty resolving issues left unresolved since the end of the American Revolution. Key provisions included:

* Britain agreed to evacuate forts in the Northwest Territory (which they had continued to occupy illegally).
* A commission was established to settle boundary disputes and debts owed to British merchants.
* The U.S. received limited trading rights in the British West Indies.

## Impact? Why Significant?: 
* **Highly Controversial:**  The treaty was unpopular with many Americans, particularly Democratic-[Republicans](./../republicans/), who saw it as a betrayal of [France](./../france/) (then at war with [Great Britain](./../great-britain/)) and a concession to a tyrannical power. 
* **Strengthened Federalist Party:** The Federalists supported the treaty, arguing it maintained peace and trade with Britain. The controversy surrounding the treaty helped solidify the two-party system in the early [United States](./../united-states/).
* **Indirectly Led to Other Agreements:** The treaty paved the way for Pinckney's Treaty (1795) with [Spain](./../spain/), which secured American access to the [Mississippi](./../mississippi/) River and New Orleans. It also temporarily eased tensions with Britain, although issues like impressment would continue to cause problems.
* **Demonstrated Challenges of Neutrality:** Jay's Treaty highlighted the difficulty for the newly formed [United States](./../united-states/) to remain neutral in European conflicts, a recurring theme in early American history.
