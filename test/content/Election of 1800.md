# ID: [Election of 1800](./../election-of-1800/) 
## When: December 3, 1800

## Who: 
- **Candidates:** 
    - **[Thomas Jefferson](./../thomas-jefferson/)** (Democratic-Republican) and **Aaron Burr** (Democratic-Republican)
    - **[John Adams](./../john-adams/)** (Federalist) and **Charles Cotesworth Pinckney** (Federalist)
- **Other Key Figures:** [Alexander Hamilton](./../alexander-hamilton/)

## What: 
- A highly contested presidential election between the Federalist Party ([John Adams](./../john-adams/), incumbent) and the Democratic-Republican Party ([Thomas Jefferson](./../thomas-jefferson/)). 
- The election revealed a flaw in the Electoral College system where electors cast two votes for president without specifying which was president and vice president.
- Jefferson and Burr tied in the Electoral College, forcing the election to be decided by the House of Representatives, where each state delegation had one vote.
- After a long deadlock and intense political maneuvering (Hamilton influenced the outcome in favor of Jefferson), Jefferson was elected president.

## Impact? Why Significant?: 
- **Marked the first peaceful transfer of power from one political party to another in the [United States](./../united-states/)**, establishing a precedent for peaceful transitions of power.
- **Signaled the decline of the Federalist Party** and the rise of the Democratic-Republican Party, ushering in an era of Jeffersonian Democracy.
- **Led to the ratification of the 12th Amendment (1804) to the Constitution**, which altered the Electoral College procedures to prevent a repeat of the 1800 tie, requiring electors to cast separate ballots for president and vice president. 
- **Exemplified the growing partisan divisions** and the intensity of political battles in the early republic.
