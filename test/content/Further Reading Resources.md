**IV.  Research Papers:**

* Keep a running list of relevant papers using a citation manager like Zotero or Mendeley.  This will require a separate [Citation Management System Setup](./../citation-management-system-setup/) note.


**Useful Equations:**

* **Mean:**  $  \mu = \frac{[[1}{N} \sum_{i=[[1}^{N} x_i  $ 
* **Variance:**  $  \sigma^2 = \frac{[[1}{N} \sum_{i=[[1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2  $ 
* **Standard Deviation:**  $  \sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}  $ 


**V. Websites and Blogs:**

*  Towards Data Science
*  Arxiv
*  Google Scholar
