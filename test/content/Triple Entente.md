## ID: Formation of the [Triple Entente](./../triple-entente/)

## When:  May 20, 1882 (Formalized the existing alliances)

## Who:
* **[France](./../france/):**  Second French Republic
* **Russia:** Russian Empire
* **[Great Britain](./../great-britain/):** United Kingdom

## What: 
The [Triple Entente](./../triple-entente/) wasn't a formal treaty like the [Triple Alliance](./../triple-alliance/), but rather a series of agreements and understandings between [France](./../france/), Russia, and [Great Britain](./../great-britain/), that solidified existing bilateral alliances.  It wasn't a single event, but a gradual process of growing cooperation in response to the perceived threat posed by the [Triple Alliance](./../triple-alliance/) (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy).  These agreements involved military and diplomatic cooperation.


## Impact: Why Significant?:
* **Counterbalance to the [Triple Alliance](./../triple-alliance/):** The Entente created a powerful counterweight to the [Triple Alliance](./../triple-alliance/), significantly increasing international tensions and contributing to the complex web of alliances that led to World War I.
* **Shifting Alliances:** The formation of the Entente reflected the changing geopolitical landscape of Europe and the growing rivalry between [Great Britain](./../great-britain/) and Germany.
* **World War I:** The pre-existing alliances and mutual defense pacts within both the [Triple Entente](./../triple-entente/) and [Triple Alliance](./../triple-alliance/) meant that a localized conflict (such as the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand) could rapidly escalate into a global war. The Entente's commitment to mutual defense ultimately drew them into World War I.
* **Limited Formalization:**  Unlike the [Triple Alliance](./../triple-alliance/), its less formal nature allowed for some flexibility, but also meant that the level of commitment among the Entente powers was less explicitly defined. This ambiguity sometimes proved problematic.
