## Spain and its Impact on [United States](./../united-states/) History: A Rundown

**Early Exploration and Colonization:**

* **1492:** Christopher Columbus, funded by Spain, reaches the Americas, marking the beginning of European colonization in the Western Hemisphere.
* **1513:** Juan Ponce de Le√≥n claims [Florida](./../florida/) for Spain, establishing the first European claim in what is now the continental [United States](./../united-states/).
* **1565:** St. Augustine, [Florida](./../florida/), is founded by Spain, becoming the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in the continental U.S.
* **16th-18th Centuries:** Spain establishes missions and settlements throughout the Southwest ([California](./../california/), [Arizona](./../arizona/), [New Mexico](./../new-mexico/), [Texas](./../texas/)), influencing the development of these regions with their culture, language, and religion.

**Conflict and Shifting Power:**

* **1763:**  Following the Seven Years' War, Spain cedes [Florida](./../florida/) to [Great Britain](./../great-britain/) in exchange for Cuba. This marks the beginning of a decline in Spanish influence in North America.
* **1783:** The Treaty of Paris, ending the American Revolutionary War, returns [Florida](./../florida/) to Spanish control. However, Spain's hold on the region weakens due to internal struggles and pressure from the newly formed [United States](./../united-states/).
* **1800:** Spain cedes [Louisiana](./../louisiana/) back to [France](./../france/) in a secret treaty. This sets the stage for the [Louisiana](./../louisiana/) Purchase in 1803, which dramatically expands the territory of the [United States](./../united-states/).

**The End of Spanish Rule and Lasting Legacy:**

* **1819:**  Spain cedes [Florida](./../florida/) to the [United States](./../united-states/) through the [Adams-Onis Treaty](./../adams-onis-treaty/), ending Spanish territorial claims in North America.
