## Hydrogen Bonds: Dipole Dipole but with hydrogen
- Only occurs in molecules with:
	- A Highly electronegative([Electronegativity](./../electronegativity/)) Element
		- O N or F
	- Hydrogen
-  $ H_2O $  has a Oxygen, a very electronegative element, and hydrogen. The oxygen will attract the other molecules hydrogen
