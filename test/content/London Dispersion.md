## [London Dispersion](./../london-dispersion/): Dipoles randomly form because an electron randomly stepped out of place
- Occurs in ALL molecules
-  $ H_2 $  is a perfectly polar molecule, but sometimes an electron will step out of place, making one side positive and one side negative, causing attraction and repulsion.
- [Polarizability](./../polarizability/) affects how MUCH london dispersion something has
# Water is weird
It has a way higher BP than it should according to everything I just said. This is because of surface tension from [Hydrogen Bonds](./../hydrogen-bonds/)
