* **Increased European support for the Union**: The battle discouraged European powers from recognizing the Confederacy, as it showed the Union's strength and determination.
* **Increased pressure for peace**: The battle's high casualties spurred calls for peace from both sides, leading to preliminary peace talks (which ultimately failed).
