# ID: [Constitutional Convention](./../constitutional-convention/) 
## WHEN: May 25 - September 17, 1787 
## WHO: 55 delegates (from 12 states, [Rhode Island](./../rhode-island/) did not participate) including:
* **[James Madison](./../james-madison/)** ("Father of the Constitution" for his role in drafting and promoting the document)
* **[George Washington](./../george-washington/)** (presided over the Convention, lending legitimacy and authority)
* **[Alexander Hamilton](./../alexander-hamilton/)** (advocated for a strong central government)
* **[Benjamin Franklin](./../benjamin-franklin/)** (elder statesman, helped forge compromises)
* **Roger Sherman**  (proposed the [Connecticut](./../connecticut/) Compromise)

## WHAT: 
Meeting held in [Philadelphia](./../philadelphia/), [Pennsylvania](./../pennsylvania/), initially intended to revise the [Articles of Confederation](./../articles-of-confederation/).  

Key Issues and Compromises:
* **Representation:** Resolved by the **[Connecticut](./../connecticut/) (Great) Compromise**, creating a bicameral legislature with representation in the House of Representatives based on population and equal representation in the Senate.
* **Slavery:** The **Three-Fifths Compromise** counted each slave as three-fifths of a person for representation and taxation purposes. The slave trade was allowed to continue for 20 years. 
* **Power of the Federal Government:** Established a system of **separation of powers** (legislative, executive, judicial) with **checks and balances** to prevent tyranny.

## IMPACT: Why Significant?: 
* **Created the [United States](./../united-states/) Constitution**, replacing the weak [Articles of Confederation](./../articles-of-confederation/).
* **Established a framework for a more powerful and effective national government** while addressing concerns about potential tyranny. 
* **Left some issues unresolved**, such as slavery, which would continue to cause tension and ultimately lead to the [Civil War](./../civil-war/). 
* **Debates over ratification** led to the development of the **Federalist** and **Anti-Federalist** factions, shaping early American political thought.
