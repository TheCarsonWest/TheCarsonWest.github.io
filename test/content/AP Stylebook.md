# [Grammar and Mechanics](./../grammar-and-mechanics/)
# [AP Stylebook](./../ap-stylebook/) Notes

**Key Sections & Concepts:**

* **Capitalization:**  Generally conservative.  Proper nouns are capitalized; common nouns are not.  Specific examples needed (see [Capitalization Rules](./../capitalization-rules/)).

* **Numbers:** Spell out numbers zero through nine; use figures for 10 and above.  Exceptions exist for ages, addresses, etc. (see [Number Usage Rules](./../number-usage-rules/)).

* **Dates & Times:**  Follow specific AP style for date and time formatting.  (e.g.,  Month Day, Year; 3 p.m., not 3 PM) (see [Date and Time Formatting](./../date-and-time-formatting/)).

* **Abbreviations:** Use sparingly.  Spell out on first reference, then abbreviate if appropriate.  (See [Abbreviations and Acronyms](./../abbreviations-and-acronyms/)).


* **Punctuation:**
    * **[Commas](./../commas/):**  Use the serial comma (Oxford comma).   $ x_1, x_2, and x_3 $ .
    * **Semicolons:** Use to join closely related independent clauses.
    * **Colons:** Use to introduce a list or explanation.


* **State Names:** Spell out state names in body text, except when used with a city name (e.g.,  "He lives in Springfield, [Illinois](./../illinois/)," but  "He moved to Ill."). See [State Name Abbreviations](./../state-name-abbreviations/).

* **Titles:** Capitalize titles before names, but not afterward. (e.g., President Biden, but the president). More detail in [Titles and Names](./../titles-and-names/).


* **Quotes:** Use quotation marks for direct quotes.  Single quotes for quotes within quotes.  Attribution should follow the quote. Example: "This is a quote," he said.


* **Attribution:**  Usually uses said, avoid more descriptive verbs (see [Attribution and Verbs](./../attribution-and-verbs/)).


* **Active vs. Passive Voice:** Prefer active voice.  Active voice is clearer and more direct.

* **Accuracy & Fairness:** Verify facts. Be fair and objective in reporting.

* **Bias-Free [Language](./../language/):** Avoid stereotypes and biased language.


**Equations (Examples):**

Inline equation: The area of a circle is given by  $ A = \pi r^2 $ .

Block equation:
 $$  E = mc^2  $$
