## Python [Operators](./../operators/)

### What are [Operators](./../operators/)?
 [Operators](./../operators/) are special symbols or [Python Functions](./../python-functions/) that perform specific operations on values. They allow the manipulation, comparison, and modification of data in Python.

### How to Use [Operators](./../operators/)
 [Operators](./../operators/) can be used in expressions along with variables, values, and other operators. The result of an operation depends on the types of operands and the operator itself.

### Types of [Operators](./../operators/)

Python operators can be classified into various types:

- **Arithmetic [Operators](./../operators/):** Perform mathematical operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulo (%).
- **Assignment [Operators](./../operators/):** Assign values to variables (e.g., =, +=, -=, *=, /=).
- **Comparison [Operators](./../operators/):** Compare values and return a Boolean (e.g., ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=).
- **Logical [Operators](./../operators/):** Combine Boolean values using AND (&), OR (|), and NOT (~).
- **[[Bitwise [Operators](./../operators/):** Perform bitwise operations on integers (e.g., &, |, ^, <<, >>).
- **Unary [Operators](./../operators/):** Perform operations on a single operand (e.g., +, -, ~).
- **Membership [Operators](./../operators/):** Check if an element is present in a sequence (e.g., in, not in).
- **Identity [Operators](./../operators/):** Compare object identities (e.g., is, is not).

### Code Examples

```python
# Arithmetic operator: add 10 to x
x + 10
```

```python
# Assignment operator: assign 5 to y
y = 5
```

```python
# Comparison operator: check if x equals 10
x == 10
```

```python
# Logical operator: check if x is greater than 0 and y is less than 10
(x > 0) and (y < 10)
```

- [Control Flow If Statements](./../control-flow-if-statements/): [Operators](./../operators/) are used in conditions to control the flow of a program.
- [For Loops](./../for-loops/): [Operators](./../operators/) can be used to modify loop variables.
- [While Loops](./../while-loops/): [Operators](./../operators/) are used to terminate or continue loops.
- [Bitwise Operators](./../bitwise-operators/): [Bitwise Operators](./../bitwise-operators/) are specialized operators that perform operations on binary data.
