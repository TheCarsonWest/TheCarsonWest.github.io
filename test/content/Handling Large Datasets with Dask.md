## [Handling Large Datasets with Dask](./../handling-large-datasets-with-dask/)

### What is Dask?
- A Python library designed specifically for handling large, out-of-core datasets.
- Provides distributed computing capabilities, enabling parallel processing across multiple cores or machines.
- Supports a wide range of operations, including data manipulation, aggregation, and machine learning algorithms.

### How to Use Dask
- Dask offers various [functions](./../functions/) and data structures for working with large datasets.

### Code Examples
- Creating a Dask dataframe from a local CSV file:
```python
import dask.dataframe as dd

df = dd.read_csv('large_dataset.csv')
```

- Perform a groupby operation on a Dask dataframe:
```python
df_grouped = df.groupby('group_column')
```

### Related Python Concepts
- [Libraries like Pandas](./../libraries-like-pandas/): Dask dataframe objects are similar to Pandas dataframes, but optimized for large datasets.
- [Distributed Computing](./../distributed-computing/): Dask leverages distributed computing to parallelize operations.
- [Concurrency and Multithreading](./../concurrency-and-multithreading/): Dask utilizes threads and processes for concurrent execution.
- [DataFrames in Pandas](./../dataframes-in-pandas/): Dask dataframes extend the functionality of Pandas dataframes for large datasets.
- [Working with Big Data using PySpark](./../working-with-big-data-using-pyspark/): PySpark and Dask are both frameworks for handling large-scale data.
