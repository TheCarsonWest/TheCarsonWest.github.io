Azeotropes are mixtures of two or more liquids whose proportions cannot be altered by simple [Distillation](./../distillation/).  This occurs because the vapor phase has the same composition as the liquid phase at a specific boiling point.  In essence, the liquid and vapor behave as a single component, making separation by [Distillation](./../distillation/) impossible.

## Types of Azeotropes

There are two main types:

* **Minimum-boiling azeotropes:** These boil at a lower temperature than either of their pure components.  The [intermolecular forces](./../intermolecular-forces/) between the components are weaker than those within the pure components, leading to a lower boiling point.  An example is ethanol and water (95.6% ethanol).

* **Maximum-boiling azeotropes:** These boil at a higher temperature than either of their pure components.  Stronger [intermolecular forces](./../intermolecular-forces/) between the components than within the pure components result in a higher boiling point.  An example is hydrochloric acid and water.


## [Vapor Pressure](./../vapor-pressure/) and [Raoult's Law](./../raoults-law/) Deviation

Understanding azeotropes requires examining deviations from [Raoult's Law](./../raoults-law/).  [Raoult's Law](./../raoults-law/) states that the [partial pressure](./../partial-pressure/) of a component in an ideal solution is proportional to its mole fraction and its [vapor pressure](./../vapor-pressure/) in the pure state:

 $ P_i = x_i P_i^* $ 

where:

*  $ P_i $  is the [partial pressure](./../partial-pressure/) of component  $ i $ 
*  $ x_i $  is the mole fraction of component  $ i $ 
*  $ P_i^* $  is the [vapor pressure](./../vapor-pressure/) of pure component  $ i $ 

Azeotropes form because of significant deviations from [Raoult's Law](./../raoults-law/).  These deviations can be:

* **Positive deviations:**  The [intermolecular forces](./../intermolecular-forces/) between unlike molecules are weaker than those between like molecules.  This leads to a higher total [vapor pressure](./../vapor-pressure/) than predicted by [Raoult's Law](./../raoults-law/), resulting in minimum-boiling azeotropes.

* **Negative deviations:** The [intermolecular forces](./../intermolecular-forces/) between unlike molecules are stronger than those between like molecules. This leads to a lower total [vapor pressure](./../vapor-pressure/) than predicted by [Raoult's Law](./../raoults-law/), resulting in maximum-boiling azeotropes.


## Breaking Azeotropes

Since simple [Distillation](./../distillation/) fails, other methods are needed to separate azeotropic mixtures:

* **Pressure-swing [Distillation](./../distillation/):** Changing the pressure alters the azeotropic composition, allowing for separation through multiple [Distillation](./../distillation/) steps at different pressures.

* **Adding a third component (entrainer):** An entrainer is added to form a new azeotrope with one of the original components, making separation possible.

* **Membrane separation:**  Utilizing selective membranes to separate components based on differences in their size or properties.
