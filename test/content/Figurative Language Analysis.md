This note covers the analysis of figurative language, focusing on identifying and interpreting different types of figures of speech.  

**Key Concepts:**

* **Metaphor:** A direct comparison between two unlike things, stating one *is* the other.  Example:  "The world is a stage."
    * Analysis: Consider the implications of the comparison. What qualities of the "stage" are being attributed to the "world"?  What effect does this have on the reader's understanding? [Metaphor Analysis Techniques](./../metaphor-analysis-techniques/)

* **Simile:** A comparison between two unlike things using "like" or "as." Example: "He fought like a lion."
    * Analysis: Similar to metaphor, examine the specific qualities being compared and the overall effect. [Simile Analysis Techniques](./../simile-analysis-techniques/)

* **Personification:** Giving human qualities to inanimate objects or abstract ideas. Example: "The wind whispered secrets."
    * Analysis: What human characteristics are attributed? What is the effect of this personification on the tone or meaning? [Personification Analysis](./../personification-analysis/)

* **Hyperbole:** Extreme exaggeration for emphasis or effect. Example: "I'm so hungry I could eat a horse."
    * Analysis: What is being exaggerated? What is the intended effect? Is it humorous, ironic, or serious? [Hyperbole and its Effects](./../hyperbole-and-its-effects/)


* **Symbolism:** The use of symbols to represent ideas or concepts.  Example: A dove symbolizing peace.
    * Analysis: Identify the symbol and what it represents. What are the layers of meaning associated with the symbol?  Consider cultural context. [Symbolism and Interpretation](./../symbolism-and-interpretation/)

* **Metonymy:**  Referring to something by naming an associated thing.  Example: "The White House announced..." (White House refers to the US government).
    * Analysis: What is the relationship between the thing named and the thing it represents? What is the effect of this indirect naming? [Metonymy Examples and Analysis](./../metonymy-examples-and-analysis/)

* **Synecdoche:** A figure of speech where a part represents the whole, or the whole represents a part. Example: "All hands on deck!" ("hands" represents the sailors).
    * Analysis: What is the part and what is the whole? What is the impact of using this figure of speech?  [Synecdoche vs. Metonymy](./../synecdoche-vs.-metonymy/)


**Equations (for quantitative analysis, if applicable):**

Frequency of figurative language can be calculated:

 $  \text{Frequency} = \frac{\text{Number of figures of speech}}{\text{Total number of words}}  $ 

This can be used to compare the density of figurative language across different texts.


##  $$  \text{Figurative Language Density} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} F_i}{W}  $$  
Where:

*  $ F_i $  is the frequency of each type of figurative language.
*  $ n $  is the number of different types of figurative language.
*  $ W $  is the total number of words in the text.
