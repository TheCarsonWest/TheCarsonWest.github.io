<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Former slaves</li>
<li>White landowners</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A system of agriculture in which landowners provided land, seed, and tools to tenants, who in return paid a portion of their crop to the landowner. This system often trapped former slaves in a cycle of debt, as they rarely had the resources to purchase their own land.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Dependence:</strong> Sharecropping perpetuated a cycle of poverty and economic dependence for former slaves, hindering their ability to achieve true economic freedom.</li>
<li><strong>Social Stratification:</strong> It reinforced existing social and racial hierarchies, limiting opportunities for African Americans and perpetuating white supremacy.</li>
<li><strong>Political Disenfranchisement:</strong> The lack of economic independence contributed to the disenfranchisement of African Americans, making it harder for them to participate in the political process and fight for their rights.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy of Inequality:</strong> The legacy of sharecropping continues to affect the economic and social disparities between blacks and whites in the South today.</li>
