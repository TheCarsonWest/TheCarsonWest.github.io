<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>William Howard Taft (1857-1930) was the 27th <a href="./../potus/">POTUS</a>, serving from 1909 to 1913. He was also the 10th Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, a position he held from 1921 until his death. Often overshadowed by his predecessor, <a href="./../theodore-roosevelt/">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, and successor, <a href="./../woodrow-wilson/">Woodrow Wilson</a>, Taft&rsquo;s presidency is marked by both successes and failures in continuing the <a href="./../progressivism%7Cprogressive-era/">Progressivism|Progressive Era</a>.</p>
<h2 id="key-events-and-associations">Key Events and Associations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Governor-General of the Philippines (1901-1904):</strong> Taft played a crucial role in establishing civil governance in the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>&rsquo; new colony after the <a href="./../spanish-american-war/">Spanish-American War</a>. He focused on infrastructure development and improving relations with the Filipino people.</li>
<li><strong>Secretary of War (1904-1908):</strong> Under <a href="./../theodore-roosevelt/">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, Taft managed the construction of the <a href="./../panama-canal/">Panama Canal</a> and served as a troubleshooter for various domestic and international issues.</li>
<li><strong>Election of 1908:</strong> Taft, hand-picked by <a href="./../theodore-roosevelt/">Theodore Roosevelt</a> to be his successor, easily defeated <a href="./../william-jennings-bryan/">William Jennings Bryan</a> to win the presidency.</li>
<li><strong>Pinchot-Ballinger Controversy (1909-1910):</strong> This conflict between Gifford Pinchot (Chief of the Forest Service) and Richard Ballinger (Secretary of the Interior) highlighted the growing rift between Taft and the progressive wing of the <a href="./../republicans/">Republicans</a>. Pinchot accused Ballinger of undermining conservation efforts, and Taft&rsquo;s decision to fire Pinchot alienated many Progressives.</li>
<li><strong>Election of 1912:</strong> Taft ran for reelection as the Republican candidate but faced a strong challenge from <a href="./../theodore-roosevelt/">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, who ran as a third-party candidate under the <a href="./../bull-moose-party/">Bull Moose Party</a>, and <a href="./../woodrow-wilson/">Woodrow Wilson</a>, the <a href="./../democrats/">Democrats</a> candidate. The split in the Republican vote allowed Wilson to win the election.</li>
<li><strong>Chief Justice of the Supreme Court (1921-1930):</strong> Appointed by President Warren G. Harding, Taft became the only former president to serve as Chief Justice. He modernized the court&rsquo;s administration and advocated for judicial reform.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="important-legislation-signed">Important Legislation Signed</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act (1909):</strong> Intended to lower tariffs, the act was heavily amended in Congress, resulting in only modest reductions and alienating Progressives who favored significant tariff reform.</li>
<li><strong>Mann-Elkins Act (1910):</strong> This act extended the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to regulate telephone, telegraph, and cable companies.</li>
<li><strong>Sixteenth Amendment (Proposed 1909, Ratified 1913):</strong> Taft supported the proposal of this amendment, which authorized Congress to levy an income tax.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="groups-and-affiliations">Groups and Affiliations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Republican Party:</strong> Taft was a lifelong Republican, but his presidency exposed deep divisions within the party between Progressives and conservatives.</li>
<li><strong>Supreme Court:</strong> As Chief Justice, Taft worked to improve the efficiency and prestige of the Supreme Court.</li>
<li><strong>Skull and Bones:</strong> As a student at Yale, Taft was a member of the secret society, Skull and Bones.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-on-the-country">Impact on the Country</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trust-Busting:</strong> Taft&rsquo;s administration pursued more antitrust cases than <a href="./../theodore-roosevelt/">Theodore Roosevelt</a>&rsquo;s, including a significant case against Standard Oil.</li>
<li><strong>Conservation:</strong> While often criticized for his handling of the Pinchot-Ballinger affair, Taft also established several national forests and reserved significant amounts of public land.</li>
<li><strong>Division within the Republican Party:</strong> The growing divide between Taft and the Progressive wing of the Republican Party, led by <a href="./../theodore-roosevelt/">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, ultimately led to the party&rsquo;s split in the <a href="./../election-of-1912/">Election of 1912</a> and the election of <a href="./../woodrow-wilson/">Woodrow Wilson</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Judicial Reform:</strong> As Chief Justice, Taft implemented reforms that streamlined the judicial process and increased the Supreme Court&rsquo;s influence.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, William Howard Taft&rsquo;s presidency was a complex period marked by both accomplishments and political challenges. While he continued some of the Progressive reforms of his predecessor, his conservative leanings and handling of key issues led to a major rift within the <a href="./../republicans/">Republicans</a> and ultimately contributed to his defeat in the <a href="./../election-of-1912/">Election of 1912</a>. Despite the controversies, Taft made significant contributions to the country through his trust-busting efforts, conservation policies, and, later, his leadership on the Supreme Court.</p>
