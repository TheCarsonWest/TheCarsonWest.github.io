<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>William Howard Taft (1857-1930) was the 27th [[POTUS]], serving from 1909 to 1913. He was also the 10th Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, a position he held from 1921 until his death. Often overshadowed by his predecessor, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and successor, [[Woodrow Wilson]], Taft&rsquo;s presidency is marked by both successes and failures in continuing the [[Progressivism|Progressive Era]].</p>
<h2 id="key-events-and-associations">Key Events and Associations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Governor-General of the Philippines (1901-1904):</strong> Taft played a crucial role in establishing civil governance in the [[United States]]&rsquo; new colony after the [[Spanish-American War]]. He focused on infrastructure development and improving relations with the Filipino people.</li>
<li><strong>Secretary of War (1904-1908):</strong> Under [[Theodore Roosevelt]], Taft managed the construction of the [[Panama Canal]] and served as a troubleshooter for various domestic and international issues.</li>
<li><strong>Election of 1908:</strong> Taft, hand-picked by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to be his successor, easily defeated [[William Jennings Bryan]] to win the presidency.</li>
<li><strong>Pinchot-Ballinger Controversy (1909-1910):</strong> This conflict between Gifford Pinchot (Chief of the Forest Service) and Richard Ballinger (Secretary of the Interior) highlighted the growing rift between Taft and the progressive wing of the [[Republicans]]. Pinchot accused Ballinger of undermining conservation efforts, and Taft&rsquo;s decision to fire Pinchot alienated many Progressives.</li>
<li><strong>Election of 1912:</strong> Taft ran for reelection as the Republican candidate but faced a strong challenge from [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who ran as a third-party candidate under the [[Bull Moose Party]], and [[Woodrow Wilson]], the [[Democrats]] candidate. The split in the Republican vote allowed Wilson to win the election.</li>
<li><strong>Chief Justice of the Supreme Court (1921-1930):</strong> Appointed by President Warren G. Harding, Taft became the only former president to serve as Chief Justice. He modernized the court&rsquo;s administration and advocated for judicial reform.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="important-legislation-signed">Important Legislation Signed</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act (1909):</strong> Intended to lower tariffs, the act was heavily amended in Congress, resulting in only modest reductions and alienating Progressives who favored significant tariff reform.</li>
<li><strong>Mann-Elkins Act (1910):</strong> This act extended the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to regulate telephone, telegraph, and cable companies.</li>
<li><strong>Sixteenth Amendment (Proposed 1909, Ratified 1913):</strong> Taft supported the proposal of this amendment, which authorized Congress to levy an income tax.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="groups-and-affiliations">Groups and Affiliations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Republican Party:</strong> Taft was a lifelong Republican, but his presidency exposed deep divisions within the party between Progressives and conservatives.</li>
<li><strong>Supreme Court:</strong> As Chief Justice, Taft worked to improve the efficiency and prestige of the Supreme Court.</li>
<li><strong>Skull and Bones:</strong> As a student at Yale, Taft was a member of the secret society, Skull and Bones.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-on-the-country">Impact on the Country</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trust-Busting:</strong> Taft&rsquo;s administration pursued more antitrust cases than [[Theodore Roosevelt]]&rsquo;s, including a significant case against Standard Oil.</li>
<li><strong>Conservation:</strong> While often criticized for his handling of the Pinchot-Ballinger affair, Taft also established several national forests and reserved significant amounts of public land.</li>
<li><strong>Division within the Republican Party:</strong> The growing divide between Taft and the Progressive wing of the Republican Party, led by [[Theodore Roosevelt]], ultimately led to the party&rsquo;s split in the [[Election of 1912]] and the election of [[Woodrow Wilson]].</li>
<li><strong>Judicial Reform:</strong> As Chief Justice, Taft implemented reforms that streamlined the judicial process and increased the Supreme Court&rsquo;s influence.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, William Howard Taft&rsquo;s presidency was a complex period marked by both accomplishments and political challenges. While he continued some of the Progressive reforms of his predecessor, his conservative leanings and handling of key issues led to a major rift within the [[Republicans]] and ultimately contributed to his defeat in the [[Election of 1912]]. Despite the controversies, Taft made significant contributions to the country through his trust-busting efforts, conservation policies, and, later, his leadership on the Supreme Court.</p>
