<p><strong>Key Differences:</strong></p>
<p>Nouns are words that represent people, places, things, or ideas.  Pronouns are words that replace nouns to avoid repetition.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Nouns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Common Nouns:</strong>  General names (e.g., cat, house, city)</li>
<li><strong>Proper Nouns:</strong> Specific names (e.g., Fluffy, White House, London).  Always capitalized.</li>
<li><strong>Concrete Nouns:</strong> Tangible things you can perceive with your senses (e.g., table, tree, music)</li>
<li><strong>Abstract Nouns:</strong> Intangible things, concepts, or ideas (e.g., love, justice, happiness)</li>
<li><strong>Collective Nouns:</strong>  Groups of individuals (e.g., team, flock, family)</li>
<li><strong>Count Nouns:</strong> Can be counted (e.g., two apples, three cars)</li>
<li><strong>Non-count Nouns (Mass Nouns):</strong> Cannot be counted (e.g., water, air, information).  Often use singular verb forms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Types of Pronouns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal Pronouns:</strong> Refer to specific people or things (e.g., I, you, he, she, it, we, they, me, him, her, us, them).  <a href="./../personal-pronoun-declension/">Personal Pronoun Declension</a></li>
<li><strong>Possessive Pronouns:</strong> Show ownership (e.g., mine, yours, his, hers, its, ours, theirs)</li>
<li><strong>Reflexive Pronouns:</strong> Refer back to the subject of the sentence (e.g., myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves)</li>
<li><strong>Intensive Pronouns:</strong> Emphasize the noun or pronoun they refer to (same forms as reflexive pronouns, but function differently).  <a href="./../reflexive-vs.-intensive-pronouns/">Reflexive vs. Intensive Pronouns</a></li>
<li><strong>Demonstrative Pronouns:</strong> Point to specific things (e.g., this, that, these, those)</li>
<li><strong>Interrogative Pronouns:</strong> Used to ask questions (e.g., who, whom, whose, which, what)</li>
<li><strong>Relative Pronouns:</strong> Introduce relative clauses (e.g., who, whom, whose, which, that)</li>
<li><strong>Indefinite Pronouns:</strong> Refer to nonspecific people or things (e.g., someone, anyone, everyone, no one, somebody, anybody, everybody, nobody, something, anything, everything, nothing)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement:</strong></p>
<p>A pronoun must agree in number (singular or plural) and gender with its antecedent (the noun it replaces).</p>
<p>Example:  The dog wagged its tail.  (Singular antecedent, singular pronoun)</p>
<p>Incorrect: The dogs wagged its tail. (Plural antecedent, singular pronoun)  Should be: The dogs wagged their tail.</p>
<p><strong>Case:</strong></p>
<p>Pronouns change form depending on their grammatical function in a sentence (subjective, objective, possessive).  <a href="./../pronoun-case/">Pronoun Case</a></p>
<p><strong>Number:</strong></p>
<p>The number of a pronoun (singular or plural) must match the number of its antecedent.</p>
<p><strong>Gender:</strong></p>
<p>The gender of a pronoun (masculine, feminine, neuter) should generally match the gender of its antecedent, though the use of gender-neutral pronouns is increasingly common.</p>
<p><strong>Equations (Illustrative - Not Directly Related to Nouns &amp; Pronouns):</strong></p>
<p>$ x^2 + y^2 = r^2 $  (Equation of a circle)</p>
