<li><strong>Patronage and the [[Spoils System]]:</strong>  [[Tammany Hall]]&rsquo;s system epitomized the spoils system, where political positions and contracts were given to loyal supporters rather than based on merit.</li>
<li><strong>Influence on City Development:</strong>  [[Tammany Hall]] played a significant role in [[New York]] City&rsquo;s infrastructure development, though often at inflated costs that lined the pockets of its leaders.</li>
<li><strong>Public Backlash and Reform:</strong> The excesses of [[Tammany Hall]] eventually led to public outrage and investigative journalism (e.g., [[Thomas Nast]]&rsquo;s cartoons), contributing to the progressive reform movements that aimed to curb political corruption.</li>
<li><strong>Immigration and Urban Politics:</strong>  [[Tammany Hall]]&rsquo;s history highlights the complex relationship between immigrant communities, urban politics, and the challenges of rapid urbanization in the late 19th century.  It provided services but also exploited vulnerable populations.</li>
