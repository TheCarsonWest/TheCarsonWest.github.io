<h2 id="when-1865-1877-reconstruction-era">When: 1865-1877 (Reconstruction Era)</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<p>White Southerners who collaborated with the Republican Party and the federal government during Reconstruction.</p>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>Scalawags were a diverse group of white Southerners, including former Unionists, small farmers, and some wealthy planters. They supported Reconstruction policies like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Granting voting rights to African Americans.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Establishing public schools for all children.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Providing economic assistance to former slaves.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Creating state governments that were more inclusive of African Americans.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact">Impact:</h2>
<p>Scalawags faced significant opposition from white Southerners who resented their support for Reconstruction. They were often accused of being &ldquo;traitors&rdquo; to the South and were subject to violence and intimidation.  Despite their efforts, many Reconstruction policies ultimately failed due to a lack of support and funding from the federal government.</p>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> Scalawags represent a complex and often overlooked aspect of Reconstruction. They highlight the internal divisions within the South during this period and the struggles of those who sought to create a more just and equitable society.  The legacy of scalawags remains a reminder of the enduring challenge of racial reconciliation in the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>.</p>
