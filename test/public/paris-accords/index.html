<h2 id="id-paris-peace-accords-vietnam-war">ID: Paris Peace Accords (Vietnam War)</h2>
<p><strong>WHEN:</strong> January 27, 1973</p>
<p><strong>WHO:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Signatories:</strong> [[United States]] (represented by Henry Kissinger), North Vietnam (represented by Le Duc Tho), South Vietnam (represented by Nguyen Van Thieu), Viet Cong (represented by Madame Nguyen Thi Binh)</li>
<li><strong>Key Negotiators:</strong> Henry Kissinger (US National Security Advisor and later Secretary of State), Le Duc Tho (North Vietnamese Politburo member)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHAT:</strong></p>
<p>A peace treaty signed in Paris, France, that officially ended direct U.S. military involvement in the Vietnam War. Key provisions included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ceasefire throughout Vietnam</li>
<li>Withdrawal of all U.S. troops and military personnel within 60 days</li>
<li>Release of all American prisoners of war (POWs)</li>
<li>Agreement on the principle of self-determination for the South Vietnamese people and the eventual reunification of Vietnam through peaceful means.</li>
<li>Allowed North Vietnamese troops to remain in South Vietnam.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IMPACT: Why Significant?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>End of U.S. Involvement:</strong> Marked the end of U.S. military participation in the Vietnam War, a highly divisive and costly conflict for the United States.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Peace with Honor&rdquo;:</strong> The Nixon administration touted the accords as achieving &ldquo;peace with honor&rdquo;, though the long-term stability of South Vietnam remained uncertain.</li>
<li><strong>Fall of Saigon:</strong> The accords were ultimately a failure. Within two years of the U.S. withdrawal, North Vietnam violated the ceasefire agreement and launched a full-scale invasion of South Vietnam, leading to the fall of Saigon in April 1975 and the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule.</li>
<li><strong>Weakened U.S. Credibility:</strong> The collapse of South Vietnam after the U.S. withdrawal damaged American credibility on the world stage and led to questions about the effectiveness of U.S. foreign policy.</li>
<li><strong>War Powers Resolution:</strong> The [[Vietnam War]] and the perceived abuse of presidential power during the conflict contributed to the passage of the War Powers Resolution in 1973, which aimed to limit the president&rsquo;s ability to commit U.S. troops to military action without congressional approval.</li>
