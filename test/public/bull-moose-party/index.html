<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./../theodore-roosevelt/">Theodore Roosevelt</a>:</strong>  Former President, leading figure of the Progressive movement.</li>
<li><strong>Other Progressives:</strong>  Dissatisfied <a href="./../republicans/">Republicans</a> who supported Roosevelt&rsquo;s progressive platform.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>The Progressive Party, nicknamed the &ldquo;<a href="./../bull-moose-party/">Bull Moose Party</a>,&rdquo; was formed by <a href="./../theodore-roosevelt/">Theodore Roosevelt</a> after he lost the Republican nomination to <a href="./../william-howard-taft/">William Howard Taft</a>.  Roosevelt, believing Taft had betrayed progressive principles, launched a third-party candidacy aiming to advance a platform focused on stronger government regulation of business, women&rsquo;s suffrage, and social welfare programs.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Split the Republican Vote:</strong>  The &ldquo;Bull Moose&rdquo; candidacy directly contributed to <a href="./../woodrow-wilson/">Woodrow Wilson</a>&rsquo;s victory in the 1912 election.  By splitting the Republican vote, Roosevelt ensured neither Taft nor he could win.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Awareness of Progressive Issues:</strong> The party&rsquo;s platform significantly raised public awareness of progressive ideals, influencing future political agendas and legislation.  Many of Roosevelt&rsquo;s proposals, though not immediately enacted, would later become part of the political landscape.</li>
<li><strong>Short-lived but Influential:</strong> Though the party itself was short-lived, it demonstrated the strength of the Progressive movement and its ability to mobilize support outside the established political parties. It helped push the major parties towards adopting many of the Progressive&rsquo;s reforms.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term impact on the political landscape:</strong> The &ldquo;Bull Moose&rdquo; platform previewed many policies and reforms that would be enacted in the decades to come, signaling a shift towards stronger government regulation and social welfare programs.</li>
