<p>A groundbreaking work of economic theory published by Adam Smith.  It argues for a free market system, based on the principles of self-interest, competition, and the &ldquo;invisible hand&rdquo; regulating supply and demand.  Smith critiques mercantilism and advocates for laissez-faire economics.  Key concepts introduced include the division of labor and the concept of national wealth not being based solely on gold and silver reserves, but on the production and exchange of goods and services.</p>
