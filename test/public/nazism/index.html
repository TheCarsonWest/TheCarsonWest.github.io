<h2 id="who">WHO:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Figure:</strong> Adolf Hitler (Leader of the Nazi Party and Chancellor/Führer of Germany)</li>
<li><strong>Nazi Party:</strong> A far-right political party in Germany founded in the aftermath of World War I. Composed of followers like Heinrich Himmler, Hermann Göring, Joseph Goebbels, etc.</li>
<li><strong>German People:</strong> Supported/tolerated the Nazi regime for various reasons (economic recovery, national pride, fear).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">WHAT:</h2>
<p>A far-right, racist, and antisemitic ideology and political movement that dominated Germany from 1933 to 1945. It was based on extreme nationalism, racial superiority (specifically of the &ldquo;Aryan&rdquo; race), and a totalitarian form of government. Key tenets included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Racial Purity:</strong> Belief in a superior &ldquo;Aryan&rdquo; race and the need to eliminate &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; races, especially Jews (culminating in the [[Holocaust]]).</li>
<li><strong>Antisemitism:</strong> Intense hatred and persecution of Jewish people.</li>
<li><strong>Totalitarianism:</strong> A single-party dictatorial state controlling all aspects of life (political, economic, social, cultural).</li>
<li><strong>Aggressive Expansionism:</strong> Desire to expand Germany&rsquo;s territory and influence through military conquest (&ldquo;Lebensraum&rdquo; - living space).</li>
<li><strong>Propaganda and Indoctrination:</strong> Heavy use of propaganda to control public opinion and instill Nazi ideology.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">IMPACT: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>World War II:</strong> Nazi aggression and expansionist policies directly led to the outbreak of World War II in Europe, a global conflict that caused immense destruction and loss of life.</li>
<li><strong>The [[Holocaust]]:</strong> The Nazi regime systematically murdered approximately six million Jews in concentration camps and through other forms of persecution. This genocide is considered one of the worst atrocities in human history.</li>
<li><strong>Defeat of Germany:</strong> The Allied powers defeated Nazi Germany in 1945, ending the regime and exposing its horrific crimes to the world.</li>
<li><strong>Nuremberg Trials:</strong> Nazi leaders were put on trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity, setting a precedent for international law and the prosecution of genocide.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on US:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Entry into WWII:</strong> Nazi aggression and the attack on Pearl Harbor prompted the US to enter World War II.</li>
<li><strong>War Production:</strong> The US economy was transformed by the war effort, leading to industrial growth and the end of the [[Great Depression]].</li>
<li><strong>Post-War World Order:</strong> The US emerged as a global superpower after the war, playing a key role in shaping the post-war international order and containing the spread of communism. The lessons learned from the rise of [[Nazism]] influenced the creation of the United Nations and other international organizations aimed at preventing future conflicts and promoting human rights.</li>
<li><strong>Civil Rights Movement:</strong> The hypocrisy of fighting for freedom abroad while denying rights to African Americans at home fueled the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the US.</li>
