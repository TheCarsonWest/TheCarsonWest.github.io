<p>Benjamin Harrison was the 23rd POTUS, serving from 1889 to 1893. A Republican, his presidency was marked by significant legislative activity and economic developments.</p>
<h2 id="key-events-and-associations">Key Events and Associations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grandson of William Henry Harrison:</strong> Harrison came from a politically prominent family, which aided his career.</li>
<li><strong>Civil War Service:</strong> He served as a brigadier general in the Civil War.</li>
<li><strong>Senator from Indiana:</strong> Prior to becoming president, Harrison served as a U.S. Senator from Indiana.</li>
<li><strong>Sherman Antitrust Act:</strong> Signed into law during his presidency.</li>
<li><strong>McKinley Tariff:</strong> Another key piece of legislation during his term.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Federal Spending:</strong> Harrison&rsquo;s administration saw a significant rise in federal spending, leading to concerns about the budget.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="important-legislation">Important Legislation</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sherman Antitrust Act:</strong> Passed in 1890, it was the first major U.S. law to limit monopolies and trusts. While its initial enforcement was weak, it set a precedent for future antitrust actions.</li>
<li><strong>McKinley Tariff:</strong> Enacted in 1890, it raised tariffs to historically high levels. This was meant to protect American industries, but it also led to higher consumer prices and sparked international trade disputes.</li>
<li><strong>Sherman Silver Purchase Act:</strong> Passed in 1890, this act required the U.S. government to purchase nearly twice as much silver as before, and added substantially to the amount of money already in circulation.</li>
<li><strong>Dependent Pension Act:</strong> It provided pensions to Union veterans who had served for at least 90 days and were unable to work, regardless of whether their disability was war-related. This significantly increased the number of veterans receiving pensions and contributed to rising federal spending.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="groups-and-political-affiliations">Groups and Political Affiliations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Republicans:</strong> A staunch Republican, Harrison supported high tariffs and a strong national government.</li>
<li><strong>Grand Army of the Republic (GAR):</strong> Harrison actively courted the support of this influential organization of Union Civil War veterans.</li>
<li><strong>Business Interests:</strong> The Republicans of the time, including Harrison, were generally favorable toward businesses and industrial growth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-on-the-country">Impact on the Country</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Federal Power:</strong> Harrison&rsquo;s administration expanded the role of the federal government in regulating the economy and providing benefits to certain groups (like Civil War veterans).</li>
<li><strong>Economic Debates:</strong> The McKinley Tariff and Sherman Silver Purchase Act led to intense debates about trade policy and monetary policy, which continued to shape American politics for decades.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Conservation:</strong> Harrison designated several forest reserves, laying the groundwork for future conservation efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Re-election:</strong> Despite the legislative achievements of his administration, Harrison lost the Presidential Election of 1896 to Grover Cleveland, largely due to public dissatisfaction with the McKinley Tariff and economic concerns.</li>
