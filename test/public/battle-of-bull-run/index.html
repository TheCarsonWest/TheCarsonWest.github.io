<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>The Battle of Bull Run, also known as the First Battle of Manassas, was the first major battle of the American Civil War. It took place near Manassas Junction, <a href="./../virginia/">Virginia</a>. The battle was a Confederate victory, shattering the Union&rsquo;s initial hopes for a swift and decisive victory.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shattered Union Confidence:</strong> The Union&rsquo;s defeat at Bull Run, which was expected to be a quick victory, shocked the North and demonstrated the strength of the Confederate Army. It led to widespread disillusionment with the war effort and a realization that the conflict would be long and bloody.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Confederate Morale:</strong> The victory at Bull Run boosted Confederate morale and solidified support for the Confederacy. It also inspired the South to believe in the possibility of winning the war.</li>
<li><strong>Prolonged the War:</strong> The battle&rsquo;s outcome undermined the Union&rsquo;s initial strategy and lengthened the conflict, which ultimately had devastating consequences for both sides.</li>
<li><strong>Led to the Recruitment of More Troops:</strong>  The defeat at Bull Run spurred the Union to raise more troops and prepare for a longer war. It also prompted the Confederacy to expand its military force and strengthen its defenses.</li>
