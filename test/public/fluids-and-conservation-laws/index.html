<p>This notes page explores how fundamental conservation laws, such as conservation of mass and conservation of energy, are applied to the behavior of fluids. Building upon concepts from [[Fluids and Newtonâ€™s Laws]], we will analyze fluid dynamics in terms of continuous flow and energy transformations.</p>
<h2 id="1-introduction-to-ideal-fluid-flow">1. Introduction to Ideal Fluid Flow</h2>
<p>To simplify the analysis of fluid motion, we often consider an &ldquo;ideal fluid&rdquo; with specific characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Steady Flow</strong>: Fluid velocity at any point does not change with time. Streamlines are constant.</li>
<li><strong>Incompressible Flow</strong>: The fluid&rsquo;s density ( $ \rho $ ) is constant, meaning its volume does not change under pressure. This is a good approximation for liquids and for gases at low speeds.</li>
<li><strong>Non-viscous Flow</strong>: There is no internal friction within the fluid (viscosity) and no friction between the fluid and the walls of the container.</li>
<li><strong>Irrotational Flow</strong>: The fluid has no angular momentum about any point; it does not &ldquo;swirl.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>These assumptions allow us to use powerful conservation principles to describe fluid behavior.</p>
<h2 id="2-conservation-of-mass-the-equation-of-continuity">2. Conservation of Mass: The Equation of Continuity</h2>
<p>The <strong>Equation of Continuity</strong> is a direct consequence of the [[Conservation of Linear Momentum]] for an ideal, incompressible fluid. It states that the mass flow rate must be constant through any pipe or tube.</p>
<p>Consider a fluid flowing through a pipe of varying cross-sectional area.
$  \text{Mass flow rate} = \frac{dm}{dt} = \rho A v  $
Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ \rho $  is the fluid density (constant for incompressible flow).</li>
<li>$ A $  is the cross-sectional area of the pipe.</li>
<li>$ v $  is the average fluid speed perpendicular to the area  $ A $ .</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the fluid is incompressible ( $ \rho $  is constant) and mass is conserved:
$  \rho_1 A_1 v_1 = \rho_2 A_2 v_2  $
For an incompressible fluid,  $ \rho_1 = \rho_2 $ , simplifying to:
$  A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2  $
This implies that where the pipe is narrower ( $ A $  is smaller), the fluid speed ( $ v $ ) must be greater.</p>
<p>[[Volume Flow Rate]] is defined as  $ Q = Av $ . Therefore, the Equation of Continuity states  $ Q_1 = Q_2 $ .</p>

<h2 id="3-conservation-of-energy-bernoullis-equation">3. Conservation of Energy: Bernoulli&rsquo;s Equation</h2>
<p><strong>Bernoulli&rsquo;s Equation</strong> is an application of the [[Conservation of Energy]] principle to ideal fluid flow. It relates the pressure, speed, and height of an ideal fluid at two points along a streamline.</p>
<p>Consider an ideal fluid flowing through a pipe with varying height and cross-section. The work done on the fluid by pressure differences and gravity results in changes in its kinetic and potential energy.
The equation is given by:
$  P_1 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_1^2 + \rho g y_1 = P_2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_2^2 + \rho g y_2  $
Or, more generally, as a constant along a streamline:
$  P + \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 + \rho g y = \text{constant}  $
Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ P $  is the absolute pressure of the fluid.</li>
<li>$ \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 $  is the dynamic pressure (related to kinetic energy per unit volume).</li>
<li>$ \rho g y $  is the hydrostatic pressure (related to potential energy per unit volume).</li>
<li>$ y $  is the height above a reference level.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="applications-of-bernoullis-principle">Applications of Bernoulli&rsquo;s Principle:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Venturi Effect</strong>: As fluid flows through a constriction, its speed increases, and its pressure decreases.</li>
<li><strong>Airplane Lift</strong>: The shape of an airplane wing (airfoil) causes air to flow faster over the top surface than the bottom. According to Bernoulli&rsquo;s principle, this results in lower pressure above the wing and higher pressure below, creating an upward lift force.</li>
<li><strong>Torricelli&rsquo;s Law</strong>: Describes the speed of efflux from a tank.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-assumptions-for-bernoullis-equation">Key Assumptions for Bernoulli&rsquo;s Equation:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ideal fluid flow (incompressible, non-viscous, steady, irrotational).</li>
<li>Applies along a single streamline.</li>
<li>No energy added or removed from the system (e.g., by pumps or turbines).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-relationship-to-other-principles">4. Relationship to Other Principles</h2>
<p>Both the Equation of Continuity and Bernoulli&rsquo;s Equation are macroscopic manifestations of fundamental conservation laws. The continuity equation is essentially [[Conservation of Mass]] for a moving fluid, while Bernoulli&rsquo;s equation is a statement of [[Conservation of Energy]] for a moving fluid. Understanding these connections reinforces the unifying power of conservation principles in physics.</p>
