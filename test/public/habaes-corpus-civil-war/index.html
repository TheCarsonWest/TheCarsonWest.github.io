<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>President [[Abraham Lincoln]]:</strong> Suspended the writ of habeas corpus in certain areas during the war.</li>
<li><strong>Chief Justice Roger B. Taney:</strong> Issued a ruling in the case of <em>Ex parte Merryman</em> which challenged Lincoln&rsquo;s suspension of habeas corpus.</li>

<h2 id="what">What:</h2>

<li><strong>Habeas Corpus:</strong> A legal right that protects individuals from unlawful imprisonment. It requires that a person be brought before a court and given a reason for their detention.</li>
<li><strong>Suspension of Habeas Corpus:</strong> Lincoln temporarily suspended this right in areas under Confederate control. This allowed the government to arrest and detain individuals without charges or a trial.</li>
<li><strong>Ex parte Merryman:</strong> A legal case where Chief Justice Taney ruled that President Lincoln lacked the authority to suspend habeas corpus without Congressional authorization.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expansion of Presidential Power:</strong>  The suspension of habeas corpus during the [[Civil War]] significantly expanded the power of the presidency in times of crisis, setting a precedent for future presidents to act unilaterally in times of national emergency.</li>
<li><strong>Challenge to Civil Liberties:</strong> The suspension of habeas corpus raised concerns about the government&rsquo;s ability to restrict individual liberties, particularly during times of conflict.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Debate:</strong> The suspension of habeas corpus led to a major legal debate about the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches, as well as the protection of individual rights during wartime.</li>
<li><strong>Post-War Legacy:</strong> The [[Civil War]] suspension of habeas corpus continued to be a subject of debate in subsequent legal cases and acts of Congress, contributing to the ongoing discussion of the relationship between national security and civil liberties in the [[United States]].</li>
