<h2 id="id-political-machines-of-the-gilded-age">ID: Political Machines of the Gilded Age</h2>
<h2 id="when-1870s-1900s-roughly-with-peak-influence-in-the-late-19th-century">When: 1870s-1900s (roughly, with peak influence in the late 19th century)</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Political Bosses:</strong>  Powerful figures like William &ldquo;Boss&rdquo; Tweed (Tammany Hall),  Mark Hanna (Republican), and various other local and city leaders.</li>
<li><strong>Immigrants:</strong> Often comprised a significant portion of the machine&rsquo;s voting base, receiving services in exchange for votes.</li>
<li><strong>Working Class:</strong>  Relied on the machines for jobs, social services, and assistance navigating the urban environment.</li>
<li><strong>Business Leaders:</strong>  Sometimes formed alliances with machines to gain political influence and favorable legislation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>Highly organized political organizations that controlled city and state governments through patronage, graft, and corruption. They offered services (jobs, housing, welfare) to constituents in exchange for votes and loyalty.  Controlled nominations, elections, and often government contracts, enriching themselves in the process.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Control of City Government:</strong> Machines dominated urban politics, often using fraudulent election practices to maintain power.</li>
<li><strong>Patronage and Graft:</strong>  The spoils system (patronage) rewarded loyal supporters with government jobs regardless of qualifications. Graft involved bribery, kickbacks, and embezzlement of public funds.</li>
<li><strong>Social Services:</strong>  Despite corruption, machines provided essential services to the urban poor and newly arrived immigrants, creating a system of reciprocal obligation.</li>
<li><strong>Rise of Reform Movements:</strong> The excesses of political machines fueled progressive reform movements aimed at cleaning up government and reducing corruption (e.g., Pendleton Civil Service Act of 1883).</li>
<li><strong>Influence on Urban Development:</strong> Machines played a significant role in shaping the physical landscape of cities, directing infrastructure projects and influencing zoning decisions, often for personal gain.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Political Participation (ironically):</strong> Though corrupt, machines did increase political participation among immigrant and working-class populations, offering them a voice (albeit a controlled one) in the political system.</li>
