<p>These notes outline key techniques for analyzing rhetoric.  Remember to consider the context of the text always!</p>
<p><strong>I.  Identifying the Rhetorical Situation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Audience:</strong>  Who is the intended audience? How does the speaker/writer tailor their message to this audience?  Consider demographics, values, beliefs, and pre-existing knowledge. <a href="./../audience-analysis/">Audience Analysis</a></li>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> What is the speaker/writer trying to achieve?  To persuade? Inform? Entertain?  What is their desired outcome? <a href="./../purpose-&amp;-intent/">Purpose &amp; Intent</a></li>
<li><strong>Exigence:</strong> What is the urgency or problem that prompted this communication? What event or circumstance necessitated this rhetoric?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Analyzing Rhetorical Appeals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ethos (Ethical Appeal):</strong>  How does the speaker/writer establish credibility and trustworthiness? Consider their expertise, authority, and moral character.  Are they using testimonials or citing credible sources? <a href="./../ethos-&amp;-credibility/">Ethos &amp; Credibility</a></li>
<li><strong>Pathos (Emotional Appeal):</strong> How does the speaker/writer evoke emotion in the audience?  Identify the specific emotions targeted (e.g., fear, anger, joy, hope) and the techniques used (e.g., vivid language, storytelling, imagery). <a href="./../pathos-&amp;-emotion/">Pathos &amp; Emotion</a></li>
<li><strong>Logos (Logical Appeal):</strong> How does the speaker/writer use reason and logic to support their claims?  Look for evidence, statistics, facts, and logical reasoning (deductive, inductive).  Are there any fallacies present?  <a href="./../logos-&amp;-logic/">Logos &amp; Logic</a>, <a href="./../logical-fallacies/">Logical Fallacies</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Analyzing <a href="./../rhetorical-devices/">Rhetorical Devices</a>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Figurative <a href="./../language/">Language</a>:</strong> Metaphors, similes, analogies, personification, hyperbole, etc.  What effect do these create? How do they enhance the message? <a href="./../figurative-language-analysis/">Figurative Language Analysis</a></li>
<li><strong>Sentence Structure:</strong> Consider the length and complexity of sentences.  Short, declarative sentences can create a sense of urgency, while long, complex sentences can convey detail and sophistication.  <a href="./../sentence-structure-&amp;-effect/">Sentence Structure &amp; Effect</a></li>
<li><strong>Repetition:</strong>  The repetition of words, phrases, or sounds.  What is the effect of this repetition? Does it emphasize a point, create rhythm, or evoke emotion?</li>
<li><strong>Tone:</strong> What is the overall attitude or feeling conveyed by the speaker/writer?  Is it formal, informal, serious, humorous, sarcastic, etc.? <a href="./../identifying-tone/">Identifying Tone</a></li>
<li><strong>Diction:</strong> Word choice.  Consider the connotations of words and their impact on the audience. <a href="./../diction-&amp;-connotation/">Diction &amp; Connotation</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV.  Analyzing the Text&rsquo;s Structure and Organization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction:</strong> How does the text begin?  Does it grab the audience&rsquo;s attention?  What is the thesis statement or main idea?</li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> How are the main points organized and developed?  What evidence is used to support each point?</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> How does the text end?  Does it summarize the main points?  Does it leave the audience with a call to action?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V.  Putting it All Together:</strong></p>
<p>After analyzing the individual elements, consider how they work together to create the overall effect of the text.  How do the appeals, devices, and structure contribute to the speaker/writer&rsquo;s purpose and effectiveness?  Write a concise and insightful analysis that demonstrates your understanding of the rhetorical strategies used.</p>
<p><strong>Equations (Example):</strong></p>
<p>An example of a simple linear equation:  $ y = mx + b $</p>
<p>A more complex equation showing the quadratic formula:   $$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$</p>
