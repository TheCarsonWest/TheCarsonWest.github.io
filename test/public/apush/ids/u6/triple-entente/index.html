</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>The Triple Entente wasn&rsquo;t a formal treaty like the Triple Alliance, but rather a series of agreements and understandings between France, Russia, and Great Britain, that solidified existing bilateral alliances.  It wasn&rsquo;t a single event, but a gradual process of growing cooperation in response to the perceived threat posed by the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy).  These agreements involved military and diplomatic cooperation.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Counterbalance to the Triple Alliance:</strong> The Entente created a powerful counterweight to the Triple Alliance, significantly increasing international tensions and contributing to the complex web of alliances that led to World War I.</li>
<li><strong>Shifting Alliances:</strong> The formation of the Entente reflected the changing geopolitical landscape of Europe and the growing rivalry between Great Britain and Germany.</li>
<li><strong>World War I:</strong> The pre-existing alliances and mutual defense pacts within both the Triple Entente and Triple Alliance meant that a localized conflict (such as the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand) could rapidly escalate into a global war. The Entente&rsquo;s commitment to mutual defense ultimately drew them into World War I.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Formalization:</strong>  Unlike the Triple Alliance, its less formal nature allowed for some flexibility, but also meant that the level of commitment among the Entente powers was less explicitly defined. This ambiguity sometimes proved problematic.</li>
