<p>Chromatography is a laboratory technique used to separate the components of a mixture. The mixture is dissolved in a fluid called the mobile phase, which carries it through a structure holding another material called the stationary phase. The various constituents of the mixture travel at different speeds, causing them to separate. The separation is based on differential partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases.</p>

<h2 id="basic-principles">Basic Principles</h2>
<p>Chromatography relies on the principle that different molecules in a mixture will have different affinities for the mobile and stationary phases.  A molecule with a high affinity for the stationary phase will spend more time adsorbed on it and will therefore move more slowly through the system. Conversely, a molecule with a high affinity for the mobile phase will spend more time dissolved in it and will move more quickly.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-chromatography">Types of Chromatography</h2>
<p>There are several types of chromatography, each utilizing different mobile and stationary phases and separation mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Liquid Chromatography:</strong>  The mobile phase is a liquid.  <a href="./../liquid-chromatography/">Liquid Chromatography</a></li>
<li><strong>Gas Chromatography:</strong> The mobile phase is a gas. <a href="./../gas-chromatography/">Gas Chromatography</a></li>
<li><strong>Paper Chromatography:</strong> The stationary phase is a special paper. <a href="./../paper-chromatography/">Paper Chromatography</a></li>
<li><strong>Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC):</strong> The stationary phase is a thin layer of adsorbent material, like silica gel, coated on a glass, plastic, or metal plate. <a href="./../thin-layer-chromatography/">Thin-Layer Chromatography</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="retention-factor-rf">Retention Factor (Rf)</h2>
<p>In paper and thin-layer chromatography, the retention factor (Rf) is a measure of how far a particular component travels relative to the solvent front. It is calculated as:</p>
<p>$ R_f = \frac{\text{Distance traveled by component}}{\text{Distance traveled by solvent front}} $</p>
<p>The <a href="./../rf-value/">RF Value</a> is always between 0 and 1. A component with a high affinity for the stationary phase will have a low <a href="./../rf-value/">RF Value</a>, while a component with a high affinity for the mobile phase will have a high <a href="./../rf-value/">RF Value</a>.</p>
<h2 id="analyzing-chromatograms">Analyzing Chromatograms</h2>
<p>The output of a chromatography experiment is called a chromatogram.  <a href="./../chromatogram-analysis/">Chromatogram Analysis</a> It can be used to identify and quantify the components in a mixture.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Qualitative Analysis:</strong>  Components are identified by comparing their retention times or Rf values to those of known standards.</li>
<li><strong>Quantitative Analysis:</strong> The area under a peak in a chromatogram is proportional to the concentration of the corresponding component in the mixture.  <a href="./../peak-integration/">Peak Integration</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="applications-of-chromatography">Applications of Chromatography</h2>
<p>Chromatography has numerous applications in various fields, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pharmaceutical Industry:</strong>  Drug purification and analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Science:</strong> Monitoring pollutants in air and water.</li>
<li><strong>Forensic Science:</strong> Analyzing evidence at crime scenes.</li>
<li><strong>Food Industry:</strong>  Quality control and analysis of food components.</li>
<li><strong>Biotechnology:</strong>  Separating and purifying proteins and other biomolecules.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="calculus-connections-in-chromatography">Calculus Connections in Chromatography</h2>
<p>While chromatography itself doesn&rsquo;t heavily rely on calculus in its basic application, calculus concepts become relevant in more advanced analyses and theoretical treatments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modeling Elution Curves:</strong>  Differential equations can be used to model the movement of components through the chromatographic system and predict the shape of elution curves. <a href="./../elution-curve-modeling/">Elution Curve Modeling</a></li>
<li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Calculus can be used to optimize chromatographic separation conditions, such as flow rate and temperature, to achieve maximum resolution. <a href="./../chromatography-optimization/">Chromatography Optimization</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This overview provides a basic understanding of chromatography.  Further exploration of the bracketed topics will provide more detailed information.</p>
