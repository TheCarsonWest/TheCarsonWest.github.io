</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Carpetbaggers played a significant role in Reconstruction.</li>
<li>They helped to establish a system of public education in the South.</li>
<li>They also played a role in the establishment of new political parties and the enfranchisement of Black Americans.</li>
<li>They were often criticized by Southerners for their involvement in politics and their perceived corruption.</li>
<li>Their presence in the South helped to fuel racial tensions and contribute to the end of Reconstruction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The term &ldquo;Carpetbagger&rdquo; is still used today as a derogatory term to describe people who are seen as outsiders who are trying to exploit a situation for their own gain.  It is important to note that the term is often used unfairly and without understanding the complex history of the Reconstruction Era.</p>
