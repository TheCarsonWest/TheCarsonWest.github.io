<h2 id="when-september-5-1914-and-ongoing">When: September 5, 1914 (and ongoing)</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Allied Powers:</strong> Primarily Great Britain, France, and Russia (later joined by the United States, Italy, Japan, and others).</li>
<li><strong>Central Powers:</strong> Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28, 1914, a series of alliances triggered a rapid escalation into a large-scale European conflict. By September 5th, 1914,  the Allied Powers (primarily Great Britain, France, and Russia) were formally at war with the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and their allies).  This marked the beginning of the major phase of fighting in World War I.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global Conflict:</strong> The involvement of the Allied Powers transformed a European conflict into a global war, drawing in nations across continents.</li>
<li><strong>American Neutrality (Initially):</strong> The US initially declared neutrality, but increasing German aggression (unrestricted submarine warfare, Zimmerman Telegram) eventually led to US entry in 1917.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in Global Power:</strong> WWI dramatically reshaped the global balance of power, leading to the decline of European empires and the rise of the United States as a major global power.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Impact:</strong> The war had a profound impact on the American economy, boosting industrial production, and accelerating the transition to a mass-production economy.</li>
<li><strong>Social Change:</strong> The war significantly impacted American society, spurring social and political reforms, but also fueling anxieties about social unrest and radicalism (Red Scare).</li>
<li><strong>Treaty of Versailles &amp; League of Nations:</strong> The eventual Allied victory shaped the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed harsh terms on Germany and led to the creation of the League of Nations (although the US did not join). The consequences of the treaty contributed to the rise of extremist ideologies and ultimately to WWII.</li>
