<h2 id="when-1765-1775-primarily-active-during-the-period-leading-up-to-the-american-revolution">When: 1765-1775 (primarily active during the period leading up to the American Revolution)</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li>A loosely organized group of American colonists who opposed British policies, particularly the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts.  Membership varied widely, including artisans, merchants, and laborers.  Prominent members included Samuel Adams, John Hancock, Paul Revere, and Patrick Henry (though his direct involvement is debated).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>The Sons of Liberty were a powerful underground network. They used various methods of resistance, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Boycotts:</strong>  Organized boycotts of British goods to exert economic pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Protests and Demonstrations:</strong>  Organized public demonstrations and protests against British policies.</li>
<li><strong>Violence and Intimidation:</strong>  Used violence and intimidation (sometimes) against tax collectors and loyalists.  This ranged from tarring and feathering to destroying property.</li>
<li><strong>Political Organizing:</strong>  Worked to coordinate colonial resistance and build support for independence.  They played a key role in spreading revolutionary ideas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Colonial Resistance:</strong> The Sons of Liberty were instrumental in galvanizing colonial opposition to British rule. Their actions significantly escalated tensions between the colonies and Great Britain.</li>
<li><strong>Mobilization of Public Opinion:</strong> Their activities helped to shape public opinion against British policies and fostered a sense of shared identity among the colonists.</li>
<li><strong>Precursor to Revolution:</strong> The Sons of Liberty&rsquo;s actions directly contributed to the growing momentum toward revolution and helped create the climate of rebellion that led to the American Revolution.  Their tactics and organization provided a model for future revolutionary activities.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Effectiveness:</strong> While effective in raising awareness and organizing boycotts, the Sons of Liberty&rsquo;s actions were not always coordinated or uniformly successful, and their reliance on intimidation had its limitations.</li>
