<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Warren G. Harding served as the 29th [[POTUS]] from 1921 until his death in 1923. His presidency is often remembered for its focus on domestic policy through a &ldquo;[[Return to Normalcy]]&rdquo; after [[Woodrow Wilson]] and World War I, as well as the scandals involving members of his cabinet.</p>
<h2 id="key-events-and-associations">Key Events and Associations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Election of 1920:</strong> Harding, a [[Republicans|Republican]] Senator from Ohio, won the election on a platform of &ldquo;[[Return to Normalcy]]&rdquo;, promising a retreat from international affairs and a focus on domestic prosperity. The election reflected the nation&rsquo;s weariness of war and the progressive fervor of the previous decades.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Ohio Gang&rdquo;:</strong> Harding&rsquo;s administration was plagued by corruption due to his appointment of friends and political allies, many from his home state of Ohio, to key positions. This group, known as the &ldquo;Ohio Gang,&rdquo; engaged in various illegal activities.</li>
<li><strong>Teapot Dome Scandal:</strong> The most infamous scandal of Harding&rsquo;s presidency involved Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall, who accepted bribes in exchange for leasing government oil reserves at Teapot Dome, Wyoming, and Elk Hills, California, to private oil companies. [[Teapot Dome Scandal]] severely damaged Harding&rsquo;s reputation, though he was not directly implicated.</li>
<li><strong>Washington Naval Conference (1921-1922):</strong> Harding convened this international conference to address naval arms race among the major world powers. The resulting treaties limited naval construction and helped maintain peace in the Pacific.</li>
<li><strong>Died in Office:</strong> Harding died suddenly of a heart attack in August 1923, while on a speaking tour in the West. [[Calvin Coolidge]] then became [[POTUS]].</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="important-legislation-signed">Important Legislation Signed</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget and Accounting Act of 1921:</strong> This act created the Bureau of the Budget (later the Office of Management and Budget) and the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office), providing a framework for a more systematic approach to federal budgeting.</li>
<li><strong>Fordney-McCumber Tariff Act of 1922:</strong> Increased tariff rates on imported goods to protect American industries. [[Fordney-McCumber Tariff Act of 1922]] had the effect of hurting European economies and potentially damaged international trade.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="groups-and-affiliations">Groups and Affiliations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>[[Republicans|Republican]] Party:</strong> Harding was a staunch [[Republicans|Republican]] and adhered to the party&rsquo;s conservative principles.</li>
<li><strong>Freemasons:</strong> Harding was a member of the Freemasons, a fraternal organization.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-on-the-country">Impact on the Country</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Policies:</strong> Harding&rsquo;s administration favored pro-business policies, including lower taxes and reduced government spending. This approach contributed to the economic prosperity of the early [[Roaring 20s]].</li>
<li><strong>Rise of Isolationism:</strong> Harding&rsquo;s &ldquo;[[Return to Normalcy]]&rdquo; reflected the growing sentiment of isolationism in the [[United States]], as the nation sought to distance itself from European affairs.</li>
<li><strong>Damaged Reputation of the Presidency:</strong> The scandals that emerged during Harding&rsquo;s administration, especially the [[Teapot Dome Scandal]], severely tarnished the image of the presidency and eroded public trust in government.</li>
<li><strong>Progressive Rollback:</strong> Harding&rsquo;s administration marked a partial rollback of the progressive reforms of the early 20th century. Harding&rsquo;s focus was on domestic policy, and less on pushing for new reforms.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Harding&rsquo;s presidency is a complex mix of positive and negative legacies. While his pro-business policies contributed to economic growth, the corruption and scandals that plagued his administration overshadowed his achievements and left a lasting stain on his reputation and the office of [[POTUS]]. Harding&rsquo;s &ldquo;[[Return to Normalcy]]&rdquo; represented a shift in the national mood after World War I, but it also contributed to the rise of isolationism and a neglect of pressing social issues.</p>
