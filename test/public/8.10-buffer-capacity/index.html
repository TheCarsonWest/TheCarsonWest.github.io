<h2 id="what-is-buffer-capacity">What is Buffer Capacity?</h2>
<p>Buffer capacity is a measure of how well a buffer solution can resist changes in pH upon the addition of a strong acid or a strong base.  It quantifies the amount of strong acid or base that can be added before a significant change in pH occurs.  A buffer with a high capacity can neutralize more added acid or base than a buffer with a low capacity.</p>
<h2 id="factors-affecting-buffer-capacity">Factors Affecting Buffer Capacity</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Concentration of the Buffer Components:</strong>  The higher the concentrations of the weak acid and its conjugate base (or weak base and its conjugate acid), the greater the buffer capacity.  A more concentrated buffer can neutralize more added acid or base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ratio of the Buffer Components:</strong>  Buffer capacity is optimal when the concentrations of the weak acid (HA) and its conjugate base (A-) are equal, i.e., [HA] = [A-]. The further the ratio deviates from 1, the lower the buffer capacity.  The buffer is most effective within approximately Â±1 pH unit of its pKa.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="quantifying-buffer-capacity">Quantifying Buffer Capacity</h2>
<p>Buffer capacity isn&rsquo;t typically expressed with a specific numerical value with units in AP chem.  Instead, it&rsquo;s assessed qualitatively by comparing different buffer systems and considering the factors described above. However, one can think of it as the moles of acid/base needed to cause a certain pH change, but that&rsquo;s not tested in AP chem.</p>
<h2 id="henderson-hasselbalch-equation-and-buffer-range">Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation and Buffer Range</h2>
<p>The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is useful for understanding the effective pH range of a buffer:</p>
<p>$$ pH = pK_a + log \frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} $$<br>
Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ pH $  is the pH of the buffer solution.</li>
<li>$ pK_a $  is the negative logarithm of the [[Acid Dissociation Constant]] ( $ K_a $ ) of the weak acid. ( $ pK_a = -log(K_a) $ ).</li>
<li>$ [A^-] $  is the concentration of the conjugate base.</li>
<li>$ [HA] $  is the concentration of the weak acid.</li>
</ul>
<p>The effective buffer range is generally considered to be  $ pH = pK_a \pm 1 $ .  Outside this range, the buffer&rsquo;s ability to resist pH changes diminishes significantly.</p>
<h2 id="buffer-capacity-and-titration">Buffer Capacity and Titration</h2>
<p>During a [[Titration]], the buffering region is where the pH changes slowly as the titrant (strong acid or base) is added. Buffer capacity is related to the slope of the titration curve; a flatter slope indicates a higher buffer capacity. The buffer capacity is at its maximum at the half-equivalence point, where  $ [HA] = [A^-] $  and  $ pH = pK_a $ .  Past the equivalence point the buffer is exhausted.</p>
<h2 id="limiting-reactant">Limiting Reactant</h2>
<p>When adding a strong acid/base to a buffer, it is important to remember the concept of a limiting reactant.
For example, if you add a strong acid to a buffer made from a weak acid and its conjugate base, the strong acid will react with the conjugate base. To determine the new concentrations of the weak acid and conjugate base, it&rsquo;s best to use an [[ICE Tables]] table with the strong acid/base acting as the &ldquo;change&rdquo; in the ICE table. Then using the new concentrations to calculate the new pH with the henderson hasselbalch equation.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<ul>
<li>A buffer solution containing 1.0 M acetic acid and 1.0 M sodium acetate has a greater capacity than a buffer solution containing 0.1 M acetic acid and 0.1 M sodium acetate.</li>
<li>A buffer solution containing equal concentrations of a weak acid and its conjugate base has a higher buffer capacity than a buffer solution where the concentration of the weak acid is significantly higher than the concentration of its conjugate base.</li>
