<h1 id="apush-period-1-english-colonization-1491-1607">APUSH Period 1: English Colonization (1491-1607)</h1>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<ul>
<li>England was a latecomer to colonization compared to Spain &amp; Portugal.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Rivalry with Catholic Spain (religious &amp; imperial).</li>
<li>Desire for wealth (gold, resources, new markets).</li>
<li>Religious freedom/spread of Protestantism.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Safety valve&rdquo; for growing population/poverty (though more impactful later).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-people--their-roles">Key People &amp; Their Roles</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>John Cabot (1497):</strong> First English explorer to claim land in North America (Newfoundland), setting an early precedent.</li>
<li><strong>Queen Elizabeth I (reigned 1558-1603):</strong> Supported exploration, privateering against Spanish ships, and early colonization efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Sir Walter Raleigh (1580s):</strong> Financed the failed Roanoke Island colonies, demonstrating the challenges of colonization.</li>
<li><strong>Richard Hakluyt (late 16th c.):</strong> Wrote influential pamphlets advocating for colonization, emphasizing economic, religious, and political benefits for England.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-events">Key Events</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>1497: John Cabot&rsquo;s Voyage:</strong> Explored the coast of Newfoundland, claiming it for England, though no permanent settlement was established.</li>
<li><strong>1585-1590: Roanoke Island Colonies (The &ldquo;Lost Colony&rdquo;):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Series of attempts by Sir Walter Raleigh to establish a permanent settlement off the coast of North Carolina.</li>
<li><strong>1587:</strong> Final group of colonists arrived, led by John White.</li>
<li><strong>1590:</strong> White returned to find the colony deserted, with the word &ldquo;Croatoan&rdquo; carved into a tree. The fate of the colonists remains a mystery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="significance">Significance</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Failures:</strong> Roanoke demonstrated the immense challenges of establishing colonies (logistics, supply, Native relations, disease).</li>
<li><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> Highlighted the need for better planning, sustained funding (leading to the later joint-stock company model), and a deeper understanding of the American environment.</li>
<li><strong>Foundation for Future Attempts:</strong> Despite failures, this period established the desire and theoretical framework for English colonization, laying the groundwork for the successful settlements beginning in 1607 (Jamestown, which falls into Period 2 but is a direct result of these early lessons).</li>
<li><strong>Mercantilist Ideas:</strong> Early promotion of colonies as sources of raw materials and markets for the mother country.</li>
</ul>
