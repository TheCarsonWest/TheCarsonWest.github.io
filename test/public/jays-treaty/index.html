<h1 id="id-jays-treaty">ID: Jay&rsquo;s Treaty</h1>
<h2 id="when">When:</h2>
<p>November 19, 1794 (ratified by the Senate June 24, 1795)</p>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Negotiated by:</strong> John Jay, Chief Justice of the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> (sent by President <a href="./../washington/">Washington</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Signed by:</strong>  The <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> and <a href="./../great-britain/">Great Britain</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A treaty resolving issues left unresolved since the end of the American Revolution. Key provisions included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Britain agreed to evacuate forts in the Northwest Territory (which they had continued to occupy illegally).</li>
<li>A commission was established to settle boundary disputes and debts owed to British merchants.</li>
<li>The U.S. received limited trading rights in the British West Indies.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact? Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Highly Controversial:</strong>  The treaty was unpopular with many Americans, particularly Democratic-Republicans, who saw it as a betrayal of <a href="./../france/">France</a> (then at war with <a href="./../great-britain/">Great Britain</a>) and a concession to a tyrannical power.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthened Federalist Party:</strong> The Federalists supported the treaty, arguing it maintained peace and trade with Britain. The controversy surrounding the treaty helped solidify the two-party system in the early <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Indirectly Led to Other Agreements:</strong> The treaty paved the way for Pinckney&rsquo;s Treaty (1795) with <a href="./../spain/">Spain</a>, which secured American access to the <a href="./../mississippi/">Mississippi</a> River and New Orleans. It also temporarily eased tensions with Britain, although issues like impressment would continue to cause problems.</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrated Challenges of Neutrality:</strong> Jay&rsquo;s Treaty highlighted the difficulty for the newly formed <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> to remain neutral in European conflicts, a recurring theme in early American history.</li>
</ul>
