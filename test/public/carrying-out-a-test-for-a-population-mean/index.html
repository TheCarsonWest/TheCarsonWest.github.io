<p>After carefully Setting Up a Test for a Population Mean by defining hypotheses and choosing a significance level, the next crucial step is to carry out the test. This involves checking necessary conditions, calculating the test statistic, and determining the p-value.</p>
<h2 id="conditions-for-inference">Conditions for Inference</h2>
<p>Before proceeding with a one-sample  $ t $ -test for a population mean, certain conditions must be met to ensure the validity of the results. These are often remembered by the acronym &ldquo;RANDOM, NORMAL, INDEPENDENT.&rdquo;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Random</strong>: The data must come from a Random Sampling and a Collection or a randomized experiment. This ensures that the sample is representative of the population of interest.</li>
<li><strong>Normal</strong>: The sampling distribution of the sample mean must be approximately Normal. This can be satisfied in a few ways:
<ul>
<li>The population distribution is stated to be Normal.</li>
<li>The sample size is large (typically  $ n \geq 30 $ ), allowing the The Central Limit Theorem to apply.</li>
<li>If  $ n &lt; 30 $ , inspect a graph of the sample data (e.g., dot plot, box plot, histogram) for strong skewness or outliers. If the graph shows no strong skewness or outliers, it&rsquo;s generally safe to proceed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Independent</strong>: Individual observations must be independent.
<ul>
<li><strong>10% Condition</strong>: When sampling without replacement, the sample size  $ n $  must be no more than 10% of the population size  $ N $  ( $ n \leq 0.10N $ ). This ensures that the probability of selecting an item doesn&rsquo;t significantly change with each draw.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="calculating-the-test-statistic">Calculating the Test Statistic</h2>
<p>If the conditions are met, we can calculate the test statistic for a population mean, which follows a  $ t $ -distribution. This is given by:</p>
<p>$$  t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s_x / \sqrt{n}}
$$<br>
Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ \bar{x} $  is the sample mean.</li>
<li>$ \mu_0 $  is the hypothesized population mean (from the null hypothesis  $ H_0 $ ).</li>
<li>$ s_x $  is the sample standard deviation.</li>
<li>$ n $  is the sample size.</li>
</ul>
<p>This  $ t $ -statistic measures how many standard errors the sample mean ( $ \bar{x} $ ) is away from the hypothesized population mean ( $ \mu_0 $ ).</p>
<h2 id="degrees-of-freedom">Degrees of Freedom</h2>
<p>The  $ t $ -distribution is a family of distributions, characterized by its Degrees of Freedom. For a one-sample  $ t $ -test, the degrees of freedom (df) are calculated as:</p>
<p>$$  df = n - 1
$$<br>
Where  $ n $  is the sample size. The shape of the  $ t $ -distribution becomes more like the standard Normal distribution as the degrees of freedom increase.</p>
<h2 id="determining-the-p-value">Determining the P-value</h2>
<p>The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated from the sample data, assuming the null hypothesis is true.</p>
<p>To find the p-value:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify the direction of the alternative hypothesis ( $ H_a $ )</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If  $ H_a: \mu &gt; \mu_0 $ , the p-value is the area to the right of the calculated  $ t $ -statistic.</li>
<li>If  $ H_a: \mu &lt; \mu_0 $ , the p-value is the area to the left of the calculated  $ t $ -statistic.</li>
<li>If  $ H_a: \mu \neq \mu_0 $ , the p-value is twice the area in the tail beyond the calculated  $ t $ -statistic (since it&rsquo;s a two-sided test).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Use a  $ t $ -distribution table or technology (calculator/software)</strong>: Look up the calculated  $ t $ -value with  $ df = n-1 $  to find the corresponding probability.</li>
</ol>
<p>A smaller p-value provides stronger evidence against the null hypothesis. For a more in-depth understanding of its meaning, refer to Interpreting p-Values.</p>
<h2 id="making-a-decision-and-stating-a-conclusion">Making a Decision and Stating a Conclusion</h2>
<p>After calculating the p-value, compare it to the predetermined significance level ( $ \alpha $ ).</p>
<ul>
<li>**If p-value  $ \leq \alpha $ **: We <strong>reject</strong> the null hypothesis ( $ H_0 $ ). There is statistically significant evidence to conclude that the alternative hypothesis ( $ H_a $ ) is true.</li>
<li>**If p-value  $ &gt; \alpha $ **: We <strong>fail to reject</strong> the null hypothesis ( $ H_0 $ ). There is not enough statistically significant evidence to conclude that the alternative hypothesis ( $ H_a $ ) is true. Note: We never &ldquo;accept&rdquo; the null hypothesis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, state your conclusion in the context of the problem, relating it back to the original research question. This final step is similar to Concluding a Test for a Population Proportion, but adapted for a population mean. Remember to always acknowledge the possibility of Potential Errors When Performing Tests.</p>
