<h2 id="who">WHO:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Richard Nixon:</strong> President of the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> * <strong>Committee to Re-Elect the President (CREEP):</strong> Nixon&rsquo;s campaign organization, deeply involved in the scandal.</li>
<li><strong>G. Gordon Liddy &amp; E. Howard Hunt:</strong> Plumbers hired to carry out illegal activities.</li>
<li><strong>Bob Woodward &amp; Carl Bernstein:</strong> <a href="./../washington/">Washington</a> Post reporters who investigated and exposed the scandal.</li>
<li><strong>John Dean:</strong> White House Counsel who provided damaging testimony against Nixon.</li>
<li><strong>Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox:</strong> Investigated the Watergate affair and demanded the tapes.</li>
<li><strong>Judge John Sirica:</strong> Presided over the Watergate trials.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">WHAT:</h2>
<p>A major political scandal that began with a break-in at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate Hotel in June 1972. Investigations revealed a broader pattern of illegal activities by the Nixon administration, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The break-in itself:</strong> An attempt to bug the DNC headquarters and steal campaign information.</li>
<li><strong>Cover-up:</strong> Nixon and his aides attempted to cover up the administration&rsquo;s involvement in the break-in.</li>
<li><strong>Obstruction of Justice:</strong> Lying to investigators, destroying evidence, and using the CIA to impede the FBI&rsquo;s investigation.</li>
<li><strong>Abuse of Power:</strong> Use of government agencies (FBI, IRS, CIA) to harass political opponents.</li>
<li><strong>Illegal Campaign Contributions:</strong> Violations of campaign finance laws.</li>
<li><strong>Nixon&rsquo;s secret taping system:</strong> Revelations of a system that recorded conversations in the Oval Office ultimately proved Nixon&rsquo;s involvement. He was ordered to release these tapes.</li>
<li><strong>Saturday Night Massacre:</strong> Nixon ordered the firing of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox when he demanded the tapes, leading to the resignations of Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact">IMPACT:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nixon&rsquo;s Resignation:</strong> Facing impeachment by the House of Representatives and near-certain conviction by the Senate, Nixon resigned from office in August 1974.</li>
<li><strong>Ford&rsquo;s Pardon of Nixon:</strong> Gerald Ford, Nixon&rsquo;s successor, pardoned Nixon, sparking controversy but aiming to heal the nation.</li>
<li><strong>Erosion of Public Trust:</strong>  The scandal significantly damaged public trust in government and political institutions. It fostered widespread cynicism about politicians and the presidency.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthening of Investigative Journalism:</strong> Woodward and Bernstein&rsquo;s reporting highlighted the importance of a free press and investigative journalism in holding those in power accountable.</li>
<li><strong>Campaign Finance Reform:</strong> The scandal led to reforms in campaign finance laws to limit contributions and increase transparency.</li>
<li><strong>Governmental Ethics Reforms:</strong> Increased emphasis on government ethics and accountability, including the creation of stricter ethical guidelines for government officials.</li>
<li><strong>War Powers Act:</strong> Although not a direct result, Watergate contributed to a climate of distrust that led to the passage of the War Powers Act in 1973, limiting presidential power to commit troops without Congressional approval.</li>
<li><strong>Lasting Legacy:</strong> The term &ldquo;Watergate&rdquo; became synonymous with political scandal and abuse of power. It continues to be referenced in discussions of governmental wrongdoing.</li>
