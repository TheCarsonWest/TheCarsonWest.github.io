<p>ID: Tariff of Abominations</p>
<h2 id="when-1828">When: 1828</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:  </h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="./../andrew-jackson/">Andrew Jackson</a>:</strong> President at the time, though he opposed the tariff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Henry Clay:</strong> Architect of the tariff and Secretary of State.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>John C. Calhoun:</strong> <a href="./../south-carolina/">South Carolina</a> Senator who vehemently opposed the tariff.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What: </h2>
<p>The Tariff of 1828, often referred to as the &ldquo;Tariff of Abominations,&rdquo; was a high protective tariff passed by the US Congress. It was designed to protect Northern industries from British competition, but it heavily burdened Southern economies reliant on exporting agricultural products.  The South saw it as an unfair tax benefiting the North at their expense.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact? Why Significant?: </h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="./../nullification/">Nullification</a> Crisis:</strong> The tariff sparked a major political crisis. <a href="./../south-carolina/">South Carolina</a>, led by Calhoun, threatened to nullify the tariff within its borders, arguing states had the right to void federal Laws they deemed unconstitutional.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased sectionalism:</strong> The tariff deepened the divide between the North and South, fueling the debate over states&rsquo; rights and the balance of power within the federal system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strengthened Jacksonian Democracy:</strong>  The crisis led to increased support for Jackson and his party, who advocated for a strong central government. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Precursor to the Civil War:</strong> The tariff was a significant early flashpoint in the growing tension between North and South, contributing to the eventual outbreak of the Civil War. </p>
</li>

<p>Yo, what&rsquo;s up sigmas? Let&rsquo;s talk about the Tariff of Abominations, a skibidi situation that really got us before GTA 6.</p>
<p>So, picture this: 1828, Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s in the White House, and Henry Clay, the Rizzler of politics, cooks up this high tariff. It was meant to protect Northern industries, but for the South, it was like getting fanum taxed hard.</p>
<p>John C. Calhoun, a South Carolina senator, was like, &ldquo;This is cringe, blud!&rdquo; He argued the tariff was unconstitutional and threatened to nullify it, meaning South Carolina would just ignore it. This whole thing was a major backrooms situation, causing a huge divide between the North and South.</p>
<p>The Tariff of Abominations was a major turning point, showing just how deep the tensions were between the North and South.  It was a huge contributor to the eventual Civil War.</p>
<p>Think about it, this whole thing was a Skibidi slider of a political crisis.</p>
<p>So next time you hear someone talking about the Tariff of Abominations, you&rsquo;ll know it was a big deal, a real &ldquo;before GTA 6&rdquo; kind of event.</p>
