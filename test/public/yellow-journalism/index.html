<p>A style of journalism characterized by sensationalism, exaggeration, and a focus on scandals, crime, and human-interest stories.

This approach was particularly prominent in the coverage of the <a href="./../spanish-american-war/">Spanish-American War</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Newspaper Circulation:</strong> Yellow journalism dramatically increased newspaper readership, transforming the media landscape and its influence on public opinion.</li>
<li><strong>Fueled Public Support for War:</strong> Sensationalized reporting on Spanish atrocities in Cuba, even if exaggerated or fabricated, swayed American public opinion in favor of war with <a href="./../spain/">Spain</a>, leading to increased pressure on the government to intervene.</li>
<li><strong>Rise of Mass Media&rsquo;s Power:</strong> Demonstrated the power of mass media to shape public perception and influence political decisions.  It foreshadowed the immense impact of media on future events.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical Concerns:</strong> Raised serious ethical questions about the responsibility of the press and the potential for manipulation of the public through biased and inaccurate reporting.  It led to calls for greater journalistic integrity, though the practices persisted in various forms.</li>
<li><strong><a href="./../spanish-american-war/">Spanish-American War</a>:</strong>  A direct contributor to the outbreak of the <a href="./../spanish-american-war/">Spanish-American War</a> in 1898.  The public&rsquo;s appetite for war, fueled by sensationalized accounts, made intervention politically viable.</li>
