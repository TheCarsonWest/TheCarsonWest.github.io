<p>These notes outline criteria for evaluating information sources.  The goal is to determine the credibility, reliability, and authority of a source before using it in research or decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>I. Authority:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author Expertise:</strong>  What are the author&rsquo;s credentials?   $ expertise = f(education, experience, publications) $   Are they recognized experts in the field? <a href="./../author-expertise-evaluation/">Author Expertise Evaluation</a></li>
<li><strong>Publisher Reputation:</strong> Is the source published by a reputable organization or journal?  Consider the publisher&rsquo;s history, mission, and peer-review processes. <a href="./../publisher-reputation/">Publisher Reputation</a></li>
<li><strong>Source Type:</strong> What type of source is it (e.g., scholarly article, website, book, government document)? Different source types have different levels of credibility. <a href="./../source-type-credibility/">Source Type Credibility</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Accuracy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Factual Accuracy:</strong>  Is the information presented accurate and verifiable?  Are there citations or references supporting the claims? <a href="./../fact-verification-methods/">Fact Verification Methods</a></li>
<li><strong>Objectivity:</strong> Is the information presented objectively, or does it show bias or a particular point of view?  Look for evidence of bias, such as loaded language or selective use of evidence. <a href="./../identifying-bias-in-sources/">Identifying Bias in Sources</a></li>
<li><strong>Currency:</strong> How recent is the information?  Is it up-to-date and relevant to the current context?  For some topics, older information may still be relevant, while for others, it may be outdated. <a href="./../evaluating-source-currency/">Evaluating Source Currency</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Purpose:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended Audience:</strong> Who is the intended audience of the source?  Does this affect the information presented?</li>
<li><strong>Purpose of Creation:</strong> What was the author&rsquo;s purpose in creating this source? To inform, persuade, entertain, or something else?  Understanding the purpose can help to evaluate the credibility of the information. <a href="./../authorial-intent/">Authorial Intent</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. Coverage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Depth and Breadth:</strong> Does the source provide sufficient depth and breadth of coverage on the topic?  Is the information comprehensive, or does it only cover a narrow aspect?</li>
<li><strong>Perspective:</strong> Does the source present a balanced perspective, or does it focus on a particular viewpoint?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V.  Overall Assessment:</strong></p>
<p>After considering the above criteria, make an overall judgment about the source&rsquo;s credibility and reliability.  Consider using a rating system (e.g., high, medium, low) to summarize your assessment.  Document your reasoning.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Example Equation:</strong>  A simple model for source credibility could be:</p>
<p>$$ Credibility = w_1 \times Authority + w_2 \times Accuracy + w_3 \times Purpose $$<br>
where  $ w_1, w_2, w_3 $  are weights assigned to each factor based on their relative importance.  The specific weights will depend on the context and the type of source being evaluated.</p>
