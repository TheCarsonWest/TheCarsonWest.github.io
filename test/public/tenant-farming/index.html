<h2 id="id-tenant-farming">ID: Tenant Farming</h2>
<h2 id="when--late-19th-century-especially-after-the-civil-war-1865">When:  Late 19th Century, especially after the Civil War (1865)</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Former enslaved people:</strong> Seeking economic independence and land ownership, often faced limited opportunities and were forced to become tenants.</li>
<li><strong>White landowners:</strong>  Many former plantation owners, seeking to maintain control over land and labor, transitioned to tenant farming systems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A system where farmers rented land from landowners, often with a sharecropping agreement. This system involved:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Land rental:</strong> Tenants paid rent in cash or crops.</li>
<li><strong>Sharecropping:</strong> Tenants shared a portion of their crops with the landowner, often leading to debt cycles and limited economic mobility.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic hardship for tenants:</strong>  Tenant farmers often faced poverty, indebtedness, and limited opportunities for advancement.</li>
<li><strong>Social inequality:</strong> The system perpetuated racial and economic inequalities, trapping Black farmers in a cycle of dependence.</li>
<li><strong>Agricultural changes:</strong> Tenant farming led to a shift towards monocultures and a decline in diversified farming practices.</li>
<li><strong>Rise of agricultural corporations:</strong> Large landowners and corporations increasingly profited from the labor of tenant farmers.</li>
<li><strong>Rural poverty and migration:</strong> The cycle of poverty and limited opportunities drove many rural residents to seek opportunities in cities and urban areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tenant farming significantly shaped the economic and social landscape of the South after the Civil War, contributing to the rise of rural poverty and the ongoing struggle for racial equality.</p>
