<h2 id="when-august-6-1965">When: August 6, 1965</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>President Lyndon B. Johnson:</strong> Championed and signed the act into law.</li>
<li><strong>Civil Rights Movement Leaders:</strong> e.g., Martin Luther King Jr., whose activism and advocacy helped push for the legislation.</li>
<li><strong>African American Voters:</strong> The Act directly aimed to protect their voting rights.</li>
<li><strong>Congress:</strong> Debated and passed the legislation.</li>
<li><strong>Southern States:</strong> States with a history of voter discrimination.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A landmark piece of federal legislation in the United States that outlawed discriminatory voting practices that had been responsible for widespread disenfranchisement of African Americans in the U.S., especially in the South. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outlawed literacy tests and other discriminatory devices:</strong> That had been used to prevent Black citizens from registering to vote.</li>
<li><strong>Authorized federal oversight of voter registration:</strong> In areas with a history of discrimination.</li>
<li><strong>Authorized the U.S. Attorney General to investigate the use of poll taxes:</strong> In state and local elections. (Poll taxes were later outlawed by the Supreme Court in Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections (1966))</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Black Voter Registration &amp; Turnout:</strong> Dramatically increased the number of African Americans registered to vote and participating in elections, especially in the South.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Black Political Representation:</strong> Led to a significant increase in the number of Black elected officials at all levels of government.</li>
<li><strong>Empowered African American Communities:</strong> Gave Black communities greater political power and influence.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in Southern Politics:</strong> Forced a change in political strategies in the South, as politicians had to appeal to Black voters.</li>
<li><strong>Controversies and Amendments:</strong> The Act has been amended several times since its passage and has been subject to legal challenges, including Shelby County v. Holder (2013), which weakened a key provision regarding preclearance, leading to renewed concerns about voter suppression in some states.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy of Expanding Suffrage:</strong> Built upon earlier civil rights legislation and Supreme Court decisions, further expanding suffrage and solidifying the principle of equal voting rights for all citizens.</li>
</ul>
