<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Andrew Jackson (1767-1845) was the 7th <a href="./../potus/">POTUS</a> (1829-1837). A war hero and symbol of the common man, Jackson&rsquo;s presidency marked a significant shift in American politics, often referred to as the &ldquo;Age of Jacksonian Democracy&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="key-events-and-associations">Key Events and Associations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Military Career:</strong></li>
