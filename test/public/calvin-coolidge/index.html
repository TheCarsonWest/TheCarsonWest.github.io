<li><strong>Becoming President:</strong> Coolidge ascended to the presidency upon the sudden death of <a href="./../warren-g.-harding/">Warren G. Harding</a> in August 1923. He was sworn in by his father, a notary public, in the middle of the night.</li>
<li><strong>Election of 1924:</strong> Coolidge won a landslide victory in the <a href="./../election-of-1924/">Election of 1924</a>, running on a platform of continued prosperity and &ldquo;<a href="./../rugged-individualism/">Rugged Individualism</a>&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>Roaring Twenties Prosperity:</strong> Coolidge presided over a period of significant economic growth and consumerism. His policies aimed to foster a business-friendly environment.</li>
<li><strong>Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928):</strong> While not directly involved in its creation, Coolidge signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact, an international agreement that outlawed war. It was largely symbolic.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="important-legislation">Important Legislation:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926:</strong> These acts significantly reduced income tax rates, especially for the wealthy.

<h2 id="impact-on-the-united-statesunited-states">Impact on the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Growth:</strong> Coolidge&rsquo;s policies fostered an environment of economic prosperity. The stock market boomed, and wages rose for many Americans. However, this prosperity was unevenly distributed, and agricultural problems persisted.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Government Debt:</strong> Coolidge was committed to reducing the national debt, and he succeeded in lowering it during his presidency.</li>
<li><strong>Laissez-Faire Economics:</strong> Coolidge&rsquo;s belief in minimal government intervention in the economy is a hallmark of his presidency.

<li><strong>Legacy:</strong> Coolidge is often viewed as a symbol of fiscal conservatism and limited government. While his policies are credited with fostering economic growth in the 1920s, some historians argue that they also contributed to the economic instability that led to the <a href="./../stock-market-crash-of-1929/">Stock Market Crash of 1929</a> and the <a href="./../great-depression/">Great Depression</a>. His emphasis on tax cuts and deregulation is still debated today.</li>
