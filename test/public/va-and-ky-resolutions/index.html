<h2 id="when-1798-1799">When: 1798-1799</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authored by:</strong> Thomas Jefferson (Kentucky Resolution) and James Madison (Virginia Resolution)</li>
<li><strong>Adopted by:</strong>  Kentucky and Virginia state legislatures</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Resolutions written in response to the Alien and Sedition Acts passed by the Federalist-controlled Congress and President John Adams.</li>
<li>Argued that the states had the right to declare federal laws unconstitutional, specifically citing the Tenth Amendment and the idea of &ldquo;compact theory&rdquo; (that states retained individual sovereignty).</li>
<li>The Kentucky Resolution (in a more radical statement later added by Jefferson) even suggested the idea of &ldquo;Nullification&rdquo; -  that a state could void federal laws it deemed unconstitutional.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact? Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>States&rsquo; Rights:</strong>  Laid the groundwork for future arguments about states&rsquo; rights and became a foundational document for the Nullification crisis in the 1830s and, eventually, the Southern secession movement leading to the Civil War.</li>
<li><strong>Political Theory:</strong>  Introduced important concepts about the relationship between the federal government and the states, sparking a debate that continues today.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Impact at the Time:</strong> While important in the long term, the resolutions failed to overturn the Alien and Sedition Acts, as no other states adopted them.</li>
</ul>
