<h2 id="id-zimmerman-telegram">ID: [[Zimmerman Telegram]]</h2>
<h2 id="when-january-19-1917">When: January 19, 1917</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arthur Zimmermann:</strong> German Foreign Minister</li>
<li><strong>Heinrich von Eckardt:</strong> German Ambassador to Mexico</li>
<li><strong>President [[Woodrow Wilson]]:</strong>  President of the [[United States]] (indirectly involved as recipient of intercepted message)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A secret diplomatic communication issued from the German Foreign Office in January 1917, proposing a military alliance between Germany and Mexico in the event of the [[United States]] entering World War I against Germany.  The telegram promised Mexico the return of its &ldquo;lost territories&rdquo; in [[Texas]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Arizona]] in exchange for its support.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Opinion Shift:</strong> The interception and publication of the Zimmermann Telegram dramatically shifted American public opinion against Germany.  The blatant attempt to incite war on US soil and the promise of territorial concessions deeply angered many Americans.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Support for War:</strong>  The telegram strengthened the arguments of those advocating for American entry into World War I, providing concrete evidence of German aggression and undermining neutralist sentiment.</li>
<li><strong>Declaration of War:</strong> While not the sole cause, the telegram was a crucial factor contributing to President Wilson&rsquo;s decision to ask Congress for a declaration of war against Germany in April 1917.  It provided undeniable proof of German intentions and removed remaining doubts among many Americans about the need for US intervention.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthened Allied Position:</strong> The telegram boosted the morale and resolve of the Allied powers (Britain and [[France]]) by showcasing Germany&rsquo;s desperation and solidifying US support.  The shift in US public opinion made it much more likely that the US would join the war effort, changing the balance of power significantly.</li>
