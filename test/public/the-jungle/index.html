<h2 id="when-published-november-4-1905">When: Published November 4, 1905</h2>
<h2 id="who-upton-sinclair-a-muckraking-journalist-and-novelist">Who: Upton Sinclair, a muckraking journalist and novelist.</h2>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A novel exposing the appalling working conditions in the Chicago meatpacking industry.  Sinclair detailed unsanitary practices, dangerous working conditions, and the exploitation of immigrant workers. While aiming to highlight socialist ideals, the novel&rsquo;s graphic descriptions of contaminated meat shocked the public.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meat Inspection Act of 1906:</strong> Public outcry over The Jungle directly led to the passage of this act, which established federal inspection of meatpacking plants to ensure sanitary conditions and prevent adulteration of meat products.</li>
<li><strong>Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906:</strong> This act, also a direct result of public concern ignited by the book, prohibited the interstate commerce of misbranded and adulterated food and drugs.</li>
<li><strong>Increased awareness of working conditions:</strong>  Though not its primary aim, The Jungle contributed to growing public awareness of the harsh realities faced by industrial workers, fueling the Progressive movement&rsquo;s focus on labor reform.</li>
<li><strong>Rise of Muckrakers:</strong> The book&rsquo;s success solidified the role of investigative journalism (&ldquo;muckraking&rdquo;) in exposing social and political ills and influencing public policy.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in consumer attitudes:</strong> The novel fostered increased consumer demand for safer and more ethically produced food, impacting the meatpacking industry and the broader food industry.</li>
