<h2 id="when-1947-1991-officially-articulated-in-1947-though-the-policys-influence-lasted-until-the-end-of-the-cold-war">When: 1947-1991 (Officially articulated in 1947, though the policy&rsquo;s influence lasted until the end of the Cold War.)</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>George Kennan:</strong> US Diplomat in Moscow; Author of the &ldquo;Long Telegram&rdquo; (1946) and &ldquo;The Sources of Soviet Conduct&rdquo; article (published as &ldquo;X&rdquo; in <em>Foreign Affairs</em>, 1947).  Kennan is considered the architect of the [[Containment]] Policy.</li>
<li><strong>Harry S. Truman:</strong> US President who officially adopted the [[Containment]] policy with the Truman Doctrine.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A US foreign policy strategy designed to prevent the spread of communism abroad. It advocated for using a variety of means – diplomatic, economic, and military – to contain the Soviet Union and its communist allies within their existing sphere of influence. It did <em>not</em> aim to overthrow existing communist regimes, but rather to prevent them from expanding. Key elements included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Aid:</strong> Providing financial assistance to vulnerable nations to resist communist influence (e.g., Marshall Plan).</li>
<li><strong>Military Alliances:</strong> Forming defensive alliances to deter Soviet aggression (e.g., NATO).</li>
<li><strong>Diplomatic Pressure:</strong>  Using international diplomacy and organizations to isolate the Soviet Union and limit its influence.</li>
<li><strong>Proxy Wars:</strong> Supporting anti-communist forces in countries threatened by communist expansion (e.g., Korea, Vietnam).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shaped US Foreign Policy:</strong> [[Containment]] became the dominant US foreign policy strategy for over four decades during the Cold War.</li>
<li><strong>Justified Interventionism:</strong>  It provided the rationale for US involvement in numerous conflicts around the world, including the [[Korean War]] and the Vietnam War, leading to significant loss of life and resources.</li>
<li><strong>Arms Race:</strong> Fueled the arms race between the [[United States]] and the Soviet Union, leading to a massive build-up of nuclear weapons and heightened global tensions.</li>
<li><strong>Formation of Alliances:</strong> Led to the creation of key [[Cold War]] alliances like [[NATO]] and SEATO, shaping the geopolitical landscape for decades.</li>
<li><strong>Domestic Impact:</strong>  Influenced domestic policy, including increased military spending, anti-communist sentiment (McCarthyism), and the development of a strong national security apparatus.</li>
