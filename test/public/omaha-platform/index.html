<h2 id="when-july-4-1892">When: July 4, 1892</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./../populist-party/">Populist Party</a>:</strong>  The platform was drafted and adopted by the People&rsquo;s Party (<a href="./../populists/">Populists</a>) at their national convention in Omaha, <a href="./../nebraska/">Nebraska</a>.  Key figures included Ignatius Donnelly, Mary Elizabeth Lease, and James B. Weaver.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>The <a href="./../omaha-platform/">Omaha Platform</a> was the political platform of the <a href="./../populist-party/">Populist Party</a>, outlining their goals and demands for economic and political reform. It addressed issues like unfair economic practices, political corruption, and the plight of farmers and laborers.  Key planks included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free coinage of silver:</strong>  Advocated for expanding the money supply by minting silver alongside gold, believing it would boost prices and ease farmers&rsquo; debt burdens.</li>
<li><strong>Graduated income tax:</strong>  A progressive tax system where higher earners pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Government ownership of railroads, telegraphs, and telephones:</strong>  To curb monopolies and ensure fair prices and access.</li>
<li><strong>Direct election of Senators:</strong> To make the Senate more responsive to the will of the people.</li>
<li><strong>Eight-hour workday:</strong>  To improve working conditions for laborers.</li>
<li><strong>Immigration restriction:</strong> (Note: This element is often overlooked but present in the platform; reflects some of the more nativist undercurrents of the Populist movement)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Third-party influence:</strong> The <a href="./../omaha-platform/">Omaha Platform</a> demonstrated the growing power of third-party movements in challenging the established two-party system (<a href="./../democrats/">Democrats</a> and <a href="./../republicans/">Republicans</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Progressive movement precursor:</strong>  Many of the <a href="./../populists/">Populists</a>&rsquo; demands—like the income tax and direct election of senators—were later adopted by the Progressive movement in the early 20th century.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on economic inequality:</strong> The platform highlighted the growing chasm between wealthy industrialists and the working class, farmers, and laborers.</li>
<li><strong>Increased farmer political engagement:</strong>  The platform mobilized farmers and agricultural workers, resulting in increased political participation and advocacy for their concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Limited electoral success (initially):</strong> While the <a href="./../populist-party/">Populist Party</a> failed to win the presidency, the <a href="./../omaha-platform/">Omaha Platform</a> significantly influenced the political discourse of the time and laid the groundwork for future reform efforts.  The party&rsquo;s influence would wane, but many of its ideas gained wider acceptance.</li>
