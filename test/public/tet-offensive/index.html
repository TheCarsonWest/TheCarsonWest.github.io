<li><strong>North Vietnam:</strong> Viet Cong (VC) and North Vietnamese Army (NVA) forces.</li>
<li><strong>South Vietnam:</strong> Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces.</li>
<li><strong>United States:</strong> U.S. Military forces under the command of General William Westmoreland</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>

<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turning Point in Public Opinion:</strong> Despite being a military defeat for the communists (VC/NVA suffered heavy casualties), the <a href="./../tet-offensive/">Tet Offensive</a> had a profound impact on American public opinion. It exposed the credibility gap between what the Johnson administration was saying about the war (&ldquo;We are winning&rdquo;) and the reality on the ground.</li>
<li><strong>Erosion of Support for the War:</strong> The graphic images of the fighting and the scale of the offensive shocked the American public, leading to increased anti-war sentiment and protests. Support for the war plummeted.</li>
<li><strong>Decline of LBJ&rsquo;s Presidency:</strong> The <a href="./../tet-offensive/">Tet Offensive</a> significantly weakened President Lyndon B. Johnson&rsquo;s political standing. He faced increasing criticism from both hawks and doves.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in US Strategy:</strong> The offensive led to a reevaluation of U.S. strategy in Vietnam. Johnson announced he would not seek reelection and began seeking a negotiated peace settlement.</li>
<li><strong>Credibility Gap Widens:</strong> Government&rsquo;s statements about the war&rsquo;s progress were seen as dishonest, leading to further distrust in the government.</li>
<li><strong>Showed Resilience of the Enemy:</strong> It demonstrated the Viet Cong&rsquo;s continued strength and capability, despite previous claims of their imminent defeat.</li>
<li><strong>Ultimately Led to US Withdrawal:</strong> The <a href="./../tet-offensive/">Tet Offensive</a> was a major catalyst for the eventual withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam. Although the US &ldquo;won&rdquo; the battle, it lost the &ldquo;war&rdquo; for public opinion.</li>
