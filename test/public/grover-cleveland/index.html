<p>Stephen Grover Cleveland (1837-1908) was the 22nd and 24th [[POTUS]], serving two non-consecutive terms (1885-1889 and 1893-1897). A staunch believer in limited government and fiscal conservatism, Cleveland&rsquo;s presidency was marked by significant economic challenges and a commitment to upholding the gold standard.</p>
<h2 id="background-and-early-career">Background and Early Career</h2>

<li>Practiced law in Buffalo, [[New York]], gaining a reputation for honesty and integrity.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="presidential-terms">Presidential Terms</h2>
<h3 id="first-term-1885-1889">First Term (1885-1889)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Election of 1884:</strong> Won against Republican James G. Blaine in a close and scandal-ridden election. Cleveland&rsquo;s image of reform contrasted with Blaine&rsquo;s history of alleged corruption.</li>
<li><strong>Civil Service Reform:</strong> Strengthened the [[Pendleton Act]], advocating for merit-based appointments in government and combating the [[Spoils System]].</li>
<li><strong>Tariff Reform:</strong> Believed high tariffs were unfair to consumers and advocated for their reduction, leading to conflict with protectionist interests.</li>
<li><strong>Interstate Commerce Act (1887):</strong> Signed the [[Interstate Commerce Act 1887]], establishing the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to regulate railroads. This marked an early attempt by the federal government to regulate business.</li>
<li><strong>Dawes Act:</strong> While not directly involved in its creation, the implementation of the [[Dawes Severalty Act of 1887]] continued during his presidency. This Act aimed to assimilate Native Americans by dividing tribal lands into individual allotments.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="second-term-1893-1897">Second Term (1893-1897)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Panic of 1893:</strong> His second term was largely defined by the severe economic depression known as the [[Panic of 1893]]. This crisis led to widespread unemployment, business failures, and social unrest.</li>
<li><strong>Gold Standard:</strong> Firmly believed in maintaining the [[Gold Standard]] and opposed the free coinage of silver. He believed it was essential for maintaining the nation’s credit.</li>
<li><strong>Sherman Silver Purchase Act:</strong> Blamed the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] for contributing to the economic crisis. He successfully pressured Congress to repeal it in 1893.</li>
<li><strong>Pullman Strike (1894):</strong> Intervened in the [[Pullman Strike]], sending federal troops to ensure the delivery of mail, sparking controversy and angering organized labor.</li>
<li><strong>Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act (1894):</strong> Signed this tariff act, which was intended to lower tariffs but was heavily amended in the Senate, becoming less reform-oriented than Cleveland desired. He was so displeased with the final bill that he refused to sign it, but it became law anyway.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Civil Service Reform:</strong> His efforts to strengthen the civil service helped to reduce corruption and improve the efficiency of government.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Relations:</strong> His intervention in the [[Pullman Strike]] demonstrated the government’s willingness to use force to suppress labor unrest, setting a precedent for future government actions.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy:</strong> Known for his honesty, integrity, and commitment to principle, but also criticized for his conservative economic policies and handling of the economic depression of the 1890s. He left a complex legacy as a president who attempted to uphold traditional values in a rapidly changing nation.</li>
