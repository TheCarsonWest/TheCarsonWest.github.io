<h2 id="when-1754-1763">When: 1754-1763</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>British:</strong>  Supported by colonial militias (primarily from the thirteen colonies) and Native American allies (e.g., Iroquois Confederacy, initially).  Key figures include Generals Edward Braddock, Jeffrey Amherst, James Wolfe.</li>
<li><strong>French:</strong> Supported by Native American allies (e.g., Huron, Algonquin, Ottawa). Key figures include Marquis de Montcalm.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A major conflict between <a href="./../great-britain/">Great Britain</a> and <a href="./../france/">France</a> (and their respective Native American allies) over control of North America.  The war involved fighting across multiple theaters including the <a href="./../ohio/">Ohio</a> River Valley, the Great Lakes region, and Canada. Key battles include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fort Necessity (1754):</strong>  Early British defeat, highlighting colonial weakness.</li>
<li><strong>Battle of the Plains of Abraham (1759):</strong> Decisive British victory in Quebec, leading to the eventual French surrender.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>British Victory and Territorial Gains:</strong> <a href="./../great-britain/">Great Britain</a> gained control of vast territories in North America, including Canada and the <a href="./../ohio/">Ohio</a> River Valley. This drastically altered the geopolitical landscape.</li>
<li><strong>Increased British Debt:</strong> The high cost of the war led to increased taxation of the American colonies, fueling resentment and contributing to the growing tensions that ultimately led to the American Revolution.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in Native American Alliances:</strong> The war significantly weakened French influence among Native American tribes, forcing many to re-evaluate their alliances and leading to increased conflict with the British.</li>
<li><strong><a href="./../proclamation-of-1763/">Proclamation of 1763</a>:</strong> Issued by the British to prevent further westward expansion by colonists and limit conflict with Native Americans, but this angered many colonists who felt entitled to the newly acquired land.</li>
<li><strong>Seeds of Revolution:</strong> The war created a sense of shared colonial identity, but also highlighted fundamental differences in interests between <a href="./../great-britain/">Great Britain</a> and its American colonies regarding expansion, governance, and taxation.  The aftermath directly contributed to the growing revolutionary sentiment in the thirteen colonies.</li>
