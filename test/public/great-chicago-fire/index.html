<h2 id="when-october-8-10-1871">When: October 8-10, 1871</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li>No single individual is definitively blamed, but the fire&rsquo;s rapid spread was exacerbated by conditions like dense wooden buildings, strong winds, and a dry summer.  Mrs. O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s cow is a popular (though likely apocryphal) origin story.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A devastating fire that consumed a large portion of Chicago, <a href="./../illinois/">Illinois</a>, over three days.  It destroyed approximately 3.3 square miles, leaving an estimated 100,000 people homeless and causing an immense amount of property damage.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Urban Renewal and Reconstruction:</strong> The fire led to a massive rebuilding effort, which significantly reshaped Chicago&rsquo;s architecture and infrastructure.  New building codes were implemented, leading to more fire-resistant structures.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Impact:</strong> While devastating initially, the rebuilding process spurred significant economic growth and investment in the city, accelerating Chicago&rsquo;s rise as a major industrial center.</li>
<li><strong>Social Change:</strong> The fire highlighted existing social inequalities, as the rebuilding process disproportionately benefited some communities over others. It also led to improved fire prevention and safety measures across the nation.</li>
<li><strong>Technological Advancements:</strong> The scale of the disaster spurred innovation in fire-fighting techniques and equipment.</li>
<li><strong>National Attention and Sympathy:</strong> The fire captured national attention and generated widespread sympathy, leading to significant aid from across the country.  This demonstrated the growing interconnectedness of the nation.</li>
