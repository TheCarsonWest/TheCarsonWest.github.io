<li>A non-fiction book published in 1963 that critiqued the widespread belief in the 1950s and early 1960s that women could only find fulfillment through domesticity and motherhood.</li>

<li><strong>Led to Increased Awareness:</strong>  The book raised public awareness of the issues facing women and created a national dialogue about gender equality.</li>
<li><strong>Inspired Activism:</strong>  The Feminine Mystique motivated women to organize and advocate for equal rights, leading to the formation of organizations such as the National Organization for Women (NOW), which Friedan co-founded.</li>
