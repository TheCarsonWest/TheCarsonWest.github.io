<h2 id="who-president-warren-g-harding">WHO: President [[Warren G]]. Harding</h2>
<h2 id="what">WHAT:</h2>
<p>&ldquo;[[Return to Normalcy]]&rdquo; was [[Warren G]]. Harding&rsquo;s presidential campaign slogan in 1920. It represented a desire to go back to the way life was before World War I and the Progressive Era. This meant a focus on domestic issues, less government intervention in the economy, and a retreat from international affairs. It included policies that supported business growth, limited immigration, and promoted traditional values. It was a rejection of Wilsonian idealism and the social reforms of the previous decades.</p>
<h2 id="impact">IMPACT:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Electoral Victory:</strong> The slogan resonated with a war-weary public, contributing significantly to Harding&rsquo;s landslide victory in the 1920 election.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in Political Focus:</strong> Signaled a shift away from Progressive Era reforms and international involvement towards pro-business policies and isolationism. This marked a more conservative era in American politics.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Growth:</strong> Harding&rsquo;s policies, such as lower taxes and reduced regulation, contributed to the economic boom of the &ldquo;Roaring Twenties.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Isolationism:</strong> The &ldquo;[[Return to Normalcy]]&rdquo; reinforced American isolationist tendencies, leading to reluctance to join the [[2425/apush/ids/u7/League of Nations]] and a focus on domestic affairs.</li>
<li><strong>End of an Era:</strong> The Era of Progressive reform had ended and America had entered a new era of prosperity that was exclusive and favored business.</li>
