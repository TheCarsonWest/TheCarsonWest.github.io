<hr>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Mercantilism was the dominant economic theory and practice among European powers during the Age of Exploration and early colonization.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> An economic system designed to maximize the wealth and power of the mother country by accumulating gold and silver (bullion) and establishing a favorable balance of trade (exports exceeding imports).</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="key-principlesgoals">Key Principles/Goals:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accumulation of Bullion:</strong> Primary goal was to acquire and retain as much gold and silver as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Favorable Balance of Trade:</strong> Exporting more goods than importing to ensure a net inflow of wealth.</li>
<li><strong>Colonial Role:</strong> Colonies existed to provide raw materials (e.g., timber, furs, precious metals) to the mother country and serve as a captive market for finished goods.</li>
<li><strong>Government Control:</strong> Heavy government regulation of the economy to achieve these goals (e.g., tariffs, monopolies).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="period-1-context-1491-1607">Period 1 Context (1491-1607):</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Driving Force:</strong> Mercantilism was the fundamental motivation behind European exploration and the initial establishment of overseas empires. The search for new sources of wealth (especially gold and silver) fueled expeditions.</li>
<li><strong>Spanish Dominance:</strong> Spain epitomized mercantilist practices in this period.
<ul>
<li><strong>Key &ldquo;Events&rdquo;:</strong> Columbus&rsquo;s voyages, the conquests of the Aztec (Cortez) and Inca (Pizarro) empires, and the subsequent discovery and extraction of vast silver deposits (e.g., Potos√≠ in Bolivia) and gold from the Americas.</li>
<li><strong>Key &ldquo;People/Entities&rdquo;:</strong> The Spanish Crown (Ferdinand &amp; Isabella, Charles V) actively sponsored expeditions and established systems (like the <code>encomienda</code> and <code>repartimiento</code> labor systems) to exploit colonial resources for the benefit of Spain. Explorers like <strong>Columbus, Cortez, and Pizzaro</strong> acted as agents of this system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Early English/French/Dutch Actions:</strong> While not yet establishing major, profitable colonies like Spain, their early expeditions (e.g., English search for a Northwest Passage, French fur trade interests) were also driven by mercantilist desires for new resources and trade routes to increase national wealth.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="significance">Significance:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fueled Imperialism:</strong> Directly led to intense competition and rivalries among European nations for colonial territories and resources.</li>
<li><strong>Shaped Colonial Economies:</strong> Established a dependent relationship where colonies were limited in their economic development and primarily served the needs of the mother country.</li>
<li><strong>Foundation for Exploitation:</strong> Laid the groundwork for centuries of colonial exploitation, resource extraction, and the transatlantic slave trade (to provide labor for resource production).</li>
<li><strong>Wealth Transfer:</strong> Resulted in a massive transfer of wealth from the Americas to Europe, profoundly impacting European economies and societies.</li>
