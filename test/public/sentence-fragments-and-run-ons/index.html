<p>These notes cover identifying and correcting sentence fragments and run-on sentences.</p>
<p><strong>I. Sentence Fragments:</strong></p>
<p>A sentence fragment is an incomplete sentence; it lacks a subject, a verb, or both, or it doesn&rsquo;t express a complete thought.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Types of Fragments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dependent Clause Fragments:</strong> These begin with subordinating conjunctions (e.g., because, although, since, if, while) or relative pronouns (e.g., who, whom, which, that).  Example: Because it was raining.  ([[Dependent Clauses]])</li>
<li><strong>Phrase Fragments:</strong> These are groups of words that lack a subject and a verb. Example: Running down the street.</li>
<li><strong>Missing Subject Fragments:</strong> The verb is present, but the subject is missing. Example: Ate all the cookies.</li>
<li><strong>Missing Verb Fragments:</strong> The subject is present, but the verb is missing. Example: The dog in the yard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Correcting Fragments:</strong>  Add the missing elements to create a complete sentence.  For example, Because it was raining, the game was cancelled. or The dog in the yard barked loudly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Run-on Sentences:</strong></p>
<p>A run-on sentence (also called a fused sentence or a comma splice) occurs when two or more independent clauses are joined incorrectly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Types of Run-ons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comma Splice:</strong> Two independent clauses joined only by a comma. Example: The cat sat on the mat, it looked very comfortable.</li>
<li><strong>Fused Sentence:</strong> Two independent clauses joined with no punctuation or conjunction. Example: The cat sat on the mat it looked very comfortable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Correcting Run-ons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add a coordinating conjunction:</strong>  Use words like and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet to join the independent clauses.  Example: The cat sat on the mat, and it looked very comfortable.</li>
<li><strong>Use a semicolon:</strong> A semicolon can join two closely related independent clauses. Example: The cat sat on the mat; it looked very comfortable.</li>
<li><strong>Use a colon:</strong>  A colon can be used if the second clause explains or illustrates the first. Example: The cat had a comfortable spot: the mat.</li>
<li><strong>Separate into two sentences:</strong> The simplest solution is often to make two separate sentences. Example: The cat sat on the mat. It looked very comfortable.</li>
<li><strong>Use a conjunctive adverb:</strong> Use words like however, therefore, moreover, consequently, furthermore with a semicolon before and a comma after.  Example: The cat sat on the mat; however, it soon jumped down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III.  Practice Exercises:</strong></p>
<p>([[Sentence Fragment Exercises]])
([[Run-on Sentence Exercises]])</p>
<p><strong>IV. Further Reading:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>[[Grammar Handbooks]]</li>
<li>[[Style Guides]]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Key Equations (Illustrative -  not directly related to grammar, but helpful in related fields like NLP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Probability of a sentence being a fragment:  $ P(Fragment) = \frac{Number\ of\ fragments}{Total\ number\ of\ sentences} $  (This is a simplified example)</li>
<li>N-gram models can be used in sentence analysis to predict the likelihood of certain sentence structures. [[N-gram Models]]</li>
</ul>
