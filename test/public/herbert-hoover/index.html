<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Herbert Hoover (1874-1964) served as the 31st President of the [[United States]] from 1929 to 1933. A Republican, he entered office with a strong reputation as a humanitarian and administrator, largely stemming from his efforts during and after World War I. However, his presidency is largely remembered for the onset of the [[Great Depression]] and his perceived inadequate response, leading to his defeat in the 1932 election.</p>
<h2 id="key-events-associated-with-herbert-hoover">Key Events Associated with Herbert Hoover</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-Presidency Humanitarian Work:</strong> Before entering politics, Hoover was a successful mining engineer. He gained international recognition for organizing food relief efforts in Europe during and after World War I.
<ul>
<li><strong>Belgian Relief (WWI):</strong> Hoover led the Commission for Relief in Belgium, providing food and aid to occupied Belgium during the war.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Secretary of Commerce (1921-1928):</strong> Served under Presidents Warren G. Harding and [[Calvin Coolidge]], where he modernized the Department of Commerce and promoted American business interests.</li>
<li><strong>[[Stock Market Crash of 1929]]:</strong> Occurring just months into his presidency, the crash marked the beginning of the [[Great Depression]]. Hoover&rsquo;s initial response was characterized by a belief in <em>[[Rugged Individualism]]</em> and limited government intervention.</li>
<li><strong>[[Great Depression]]:</strong> The economic downturn that defined Hoover&rsquo;s presidency. Unemployment soared, banks failed, and widespread poverty gripped the nation.</li>
<li><strong>[[Bonus Army]]:</strong> In 1932, World War I veterans marched on Washington D.C. to demand early payment of bonuses promised to them. Hoover ordered the army to evict the protestors, resulting in violence that further damaged his reputation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="important-legislation-signed">Important Legislation Signed</h2>
<p>Hoover&rsquo;s actions were constrained by his philosophical belief in limited government intervention, but several pieces of legislation were enacted during his presidency:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agricultural Marketing Act (1929):</strong> Established the Federal Farm Board with the goal of stabilizing agricultural prices through government-sponsored cooperatives. Largely ineffective in combating the agricultural crisis of the Depression.</li>
<li><strong>Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act (1930):</strong> Raised tariffs on imported goods, intending to protect American industries. It is widely considered to have worsened the [[Great Depression]] by hindering international trade.</li>
<li><strong>[[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC) (1932):</strong> Provided loans to banks, railroads, and other businesses to stimulate economic activity. This was a significant step towards government intervention, but it was criticized for being too little, too late, and primarily benefiting large corporations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="groups-and-affiliations">Groups and Affiliations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>[[Republicans]]:</strong> Lifelong member of the Republican Party, believing in limited government and individual responsibility.</li>
<li><strong>Progressives:</strong> While a Republican, Hoover embraced some elements of the [[Progressivism]], particularly in his emphasis on efficiency and expertise in government.</li>
<li><strong>Business Elites:</strong> Enjoyed close ties with the business community due to his background as an engineer and administrator.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-on-the-country">Impact on the Country</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Failed to Solve the [[Great Depression]]:</strong> Hoover&rsquo;s most significant impact was his failure to effectively address the [[Great Depression]]. His adherence to laissez-faire principles and initial reluctance to engage in direct government intervention led to widespread suffering and discontent.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in Attitudes Toward Government Intervention:</strong> Despite his initial reluctance, Hoover&rsquo;s administration took some steps towards government intervention in the economy. The creation of the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] and other initiatives laid the groundwork for the more extensive [[New Deal]] policies of his successor, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].</li>
<li><strong>Damaged Public Trust in Government:</strong> The handling of the [[Bonus Army]] protest and the perceived inadequacy of Hoover&rsquo;s response to the [[Great Depression]] eroded public trust in the government&rsquo;s ability to address economic crises.</li>
<li><strong>Precedent for Later Economic Policies:</strong> Some historians argue that the RFC, while not completely successful, set a precedent for later government interventions in the economy, demonstrating that the government could play a role in stabilizing financial institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Humanitarian Legacy:</strong> Despite his controversial presidency, Hoover&rsquo;s earlier humanitarian work continued to be recognized, particularly his efforts to alleviate hunger and suffering during and after World War I.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2>
<p>Herbert Hoover was a complex figure whose presidency was largely overshadowed by the onset of the [[Great Depression]]. While his commitment to [[Rugged Individualism]] and limited government intervention initially constrained his response to the crisis, his administration eventually took steps towards greater government involvement in the economy. Despite his efforts, Hoover&rsquo;s failure to effectively address the Depression led to widespread discontent and ultimately paved the way for the [[New Deal]].</p>
