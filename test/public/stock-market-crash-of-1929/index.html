<p>A devastating collapse of stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange, beginning on October 24th (&ldquo;Black Thursday&rdquo;) and culminating on October 29th (&ldquo;Black Tuesday&rdquo;). The crash was triggered by a combination of factors including inflated stock values, overproduction, easy credit, and a speculative bubble. Panic selling led to massive losses for investors.</p>

<li><strong>Beginning of the Great Depression:</strong> The crash is widely considered the starting point of the Great Depression in the United States, although it was not the sole cause.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Contraction:</strong> Led to widespread bank failures, business closures, unemployment, and a sharp decline in consumer spending.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Savings:</strong> Millions of Americans lost their life savings as banks collapsed and stock values plummeted.</li>
<li><strong>Worldwide Impact:</strong> Contributed to the global economic crisis of the 1930s.</li>
<li><strong>Policy Changes:</strong> Led to reforms in financial regulations and the creation of new government agencies to oversee the stock market and banking system (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission).</li>
<li><strong>Shift in Government Role:</strong> Contributed to a growing expectation for government intervention in the economy to address economic crises, paving the way for the New Deal.</li>
