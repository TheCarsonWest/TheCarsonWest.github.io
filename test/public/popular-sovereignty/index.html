<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advocates:</strong>  [[Abraham Lincoln]], Stephen Douglas, Northern Whigs and [[Republicans]]</li>
<li><strong>Opponents:</strong> Southern [[Democrats]], Pro-Slavery advocates</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>Popular sovereignty was the idea that residents of a territory should decide for themselves whether or not to allow slavery. It was championed as a compromise solution to the escalating conflict over slavery&rsquo;s expansion. This concept was put into practice through the [[Kansas]]-[[Nebraska Act]] of 1854.</p>
<h2 id="impact">Impact:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fueling the [[Civil War]]:</strong> Popular sovereignty failed to resolve the issue of slavery&rsquo;s expansion. Instead, it led to violence and bloodshed in [[Kansas]] ([[Bleeding Kansas]]), as pro-slavery and anti-slavery forces clashed. This conflict further divided the nation and contributed to the outbreak of the [[Civil War]].</li>
<li><strong>Rise of the Republican Party:</strong>  The [[Kansas]]-[[Nebraska Act]] and the resulting turmoil in [[Kansas]] led to the formation of the Republican Party, which was opposed to the expansion of slavery. The Republican Party&rsquo;s rise signaled a shift in American politics and paved the way for the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1860.</li>
<li><strong>Erosion of Compromise:</strong>  The idea of popular sovereignty, initially seen as a compromise, ultimately proved to be unsustainable. It failed to address the fundamental moral and political questions surrounding slavery, exacerbating tensions between the North and South.</li>
