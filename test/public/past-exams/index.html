<p>These notes are for reviewing past exams to identify recurring themes and improve exam performance.</p>
<p><strong>Key Areas to Analyze:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Frequency of Question Types:</strong>  Track how often certain question types (e.g., multiple choice, short answer, essay) appear.  This helps prioritize study time.   $ P(type_i) = \frac{n_i}{N} $ , where  $ n_i $  is the number of questions of type  $ i $  and  $ N $  is the total number of questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Topics Covered:</strong>  Identify the most frequently tested topics.  This informs study focus.  Create a frequency distribution to visualize this. [[Topic Frequency Analysis]]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Difficulty Level:</strong> Assess the difficulty of past exam questions. [[Difficulty Assessment]]  This can be done by analyzing the average score on each question or by using a rubric.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Common Mistakes:</strong> Analyze common errors made on past exams to identify areas needing improvement. [[Common Mistakes Analysis]]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time Management:</strong>  Evaluate how long it took to answer questions and adjust time allocation strategies for future exams. [[Time Management Strategies]]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example Exam Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we have analyzed three past exams:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exam [[1]]:</strong>  Covered topics A, B, C.  Emphasis on short answer.</li>
<li><strong>Exam [[2]]:</strong> Covered topics B, D, E. Emphasis on multiple choice and problem solving.</li>
<li><strong>Exam [[3]]:</strong> Covered topics A, C, E. Balanced mix of question types.</li>
</ul>
<p>This suggests that topics A, B, and E are frequently tested. Short answer and multiple choice questions are common. [[Exam 1 Analysis]], [[Exam 2 Analysis]], [[Exam 3 Analysis]]</p>
<p><strong>Actionable Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Review notes on frequently tested topics.</li>
<li>Practice solving different question types.</li>
<li>Focus on areas where past performance was weak.</li>
<li>Develop a time management strategy for exam day.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="--textaverage-score--fracsum_i1n-s_in--">$$  \text{Average Score} = \frac{\sum_{i=[[1]]}^{N} S_i}{N}  $$</h2>
<p>Where  $ S_i $  is the score on question  $ i $  and  $ N $  is the total number of questions.  This helps gauge overall performance and identify areas needing improvement.</p>
<p>[[Exam Question Breakdown]]  This note will contain a breakdown of the types of questions asked in each past exam and their respective weightings.</p>
