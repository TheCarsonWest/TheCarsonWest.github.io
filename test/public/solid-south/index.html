<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;Solid South&rdquo; refers to the formerly Confederate states that, after Reconstruction, became unified in their political support for the <a href="./../democrats/">Democrats</a>.  This was due to a combination of factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>White Supremacy:</strong>  Southern whites sought to maintain their social and economic dominance over African Americans, using tactics like <a href="./../jim-crow-laws/">Jim Crow laws</a> and voter suppression.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Interests:</strong> The <a href="./../democrats/">Democrats</a> often aligned with Southern economic interests, particularly those tied to agriculture and the sharecropping system.</li>
<li><strong>Opposition to Federal Intervention:</strong> Southerners resented federal intervention in their affairs, especially during Reconstruction.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;Solid South&rdquo; solidified a system of racial segregation and disenfranchisement in the South, lasting for decades. This had several major impacts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited African American Political Power:</strong>  Black voters were effectively excluded from the political process, weakening their ability to advocate for their rights.</li>
<li><strong>Perpetuation of Inequality:</strong>  The South became a region of persistent poverty and limited economic opportunity for African Americans.</li>
<li><strong>National Divide:</strong> The &ldquo;Solid South&rdquo; became a significant factor in national political divisions, particularly on issues of race and civil rights.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy of Segregation:</strong>  The &ldquo;Solid South&rdquo; solidified a racial caste system that was eventually overturned by the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 1960s.</li>
