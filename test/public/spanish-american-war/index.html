<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>:</strong> President <a href="./../william-mckinley/">William McKinley</a>, Admiral George Dewey, Commodore Winfield Scott Schley, <a href="./../theodore-roosevelt/">Theodore Roosevelt</a> (Rough Riders)</li>
<li><strong><a href="./../spain/">Spain</a>:</strong>  Spanish military forces in Cuba and the Philippines</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A brief war between the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> and <a href="./../spain/">Spain</a>, sparked by the sinking of the USS <a href="./../maine/">Maine</a> in Havana harbor (though the cause remains debated) and fueled by American public outcry over Spanish atrocities in Cuba and a desire for imperial expansion.  Key battles included the Battle of Manila Bay (Philippines) and the Battle of San Juan Hill (Cuba).  The war resulted in a decisive US victory.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acquisition of Overseas Territories:</strong> The US gained control of Cuba (though it remained nominally independent), Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, marking the beginning of its emergence as a major imperial power. This dramatically shifted US foreign policy and its role in global affairs.</li>
<li><strong>Rise of American Imperialism:</strong> The war cemented a shift in American foreign policy toward imperialism, driven by economic interests, strategic considerations, and a sense of racial and cultural superiority.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Military Strength:</strong> The war demonstrated the growing power of the US military and its capacity for projecting power overseas.</li>
<li><strong><a href="./../theodore-roosevelt/">Theodore Roosevelt</a>&rsquo;s Rise to Prominence:</strong>  Roosevelt&rsquo;s leadership of the Rough Riders during the war catapulted him to national fame and paved the way for his future presidency.</li>
<li><strong>Debate over Imperialism:</strong> The war ignited a significant debate within the US over the morality and implications of imperialism, fueling anti-imperialist movements.</li>
<li><strong><a href="./../platt-amendment/">Platt Amendment</a>:</strong> This amendment, imposed on Cuba as a condition of its independence, gave the US significant influence over Cuban affairs, demonstrating the limitations of Cuban sovereignty.</li>
<li><strong>Philippine-American War:</strong>  The US victory in the <a href="./../spanish-american-war/">Spanish-American War</a> led directly to the prolonged and brutal Philippine-American War (1899-1902), further highlighting the complexities and costs of American imperialism.</li>
