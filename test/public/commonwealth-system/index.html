<li><strong>Increased Power of Northern States:</strong>  Economic success through the <a href="./../commonwealth-system/">Commonwealth System</a> contributed to the growing political and economic clout of Northern states, which contrasted with the slower industrial development of the South.</li>
<li><strong>Debate Over Government&rsquo;s Role:</strong> Sparked debates about the proper role of government in the economy.
