<h2 id="when-1898">When: 1898</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>United States:</strong> President William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt (Assistant Secretary of the Navy), Admiral George Dewey, General William Shafter.</li>
<li><strong>Spain:</strong>  Spanish government, Spanish military forces in Cuba and the Philippines.</li>
<li><strong>Cuba:</strong> Cuban revolutionaries fighting for independence from Spain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A brief war between the United States and Spain, triggered by the sinking of the USS Maine in Havana harbor (though the cause remains debated) and fueled by yellow journalism exaggerating Spanish atrocities in Cuba.  The US achieved decisive victories in Cuba (e.g., San Juan Hill) and the Philippines, resulting in the signing of the Treaty of Paris.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acquisition of Overseas Territories:</strong> The US gained control of Cuba (initially as a protectorate), Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, marking a significant departure from its previous isolationist stance and initiating its emergence as a global imperial power.</li>
<li><strong>Rise of the US as a World Power:</strong> The victory significantly boosted US international prestige and influence.</li>
<li><strong>Debate over Imperialism:</strong> The war sparked intense debate within the US about the morality and practicality of imperialism, with anti-imperialist voices opposing the annexation of the Philippines.</li>
<li><strong>Philippine-American War:</strong> The US annexation of the Philippines led to a brutal and protracted war against Filipino nationalists fighting for their own independence (1899-1902), highlighting the complexities and human cost of American imperialism.</li>
<li><strong>Platt Amendment:</strong> This amendment to the Cuban constitution limited Cuba&rsquo;s sovereignty, granting the US the right to intervene in Cuban affairs.  This exemplifies the US&rsquo;s control over Cuba despite Cuba&rsquo;s independence.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Military Spending and Modernization:</strong> The war demonstrated the need for a stronger and more modern US military, leading to increased investment in naval power and other military capabilities.</li>
