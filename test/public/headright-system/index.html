<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Colonists:</strong> Primarily wealthy landowners and the English government.  Indentured servants benefited indirectly through gaining land.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A system of land distribution in which individuals were granted land (usually 50 acres) for each indentured servant they transported to the colonies.  This incentivized the importation of laborers and fueled the growth of plantation economies.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expansion of Plantation Agriculture:</strong>  Fueled the growth of large-scale agriculture, particularly in the Southern colonies, relying heavily on enslaved labor as indentured servitude declined.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Social Inequality:</strong> Concentrated land ownership in the hands of a few wealthy planters, creating a hierarchical social structure.</li>
<li><strong>Growth of the Colonial Economy:</strong>  Provided a mechanism for colonial expansion and increased agricultural production.</li>
<li><strong>Dependence on Indentured Servants (and later enslaved people):</strong>  Created a system that relied on coerced labor to work the land, ultimately contributing to the growth of the transatlantic slave trade.</li>
<li><strong>Political Power:</strong> Land ownership often translated to political power, solidifying the influence of the wealthy elite.</li>
