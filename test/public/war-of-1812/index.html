<main>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tensions between the [[United States]] and [[Great Britain]] over trade restrictions, impressment of American sailors, and British support for Native American resistance in the Northwest Territory.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Causes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>British impressment of American sailors and seizure of American ships.</li>
<li>American desire to expand westward into British-controlled Canada.</li>
<li>British alliance with Native American tribes opposing American expansion.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Events:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invasion of Canada (1812):</strong> American failure to capture Montreal.</li>
<li><strong>Battle of Bladensburg (1814):</strong> British capture and burning of [[Washington]], D.C.</li>
<li><strong>Battle of New Orleans (1815):</strong> American victory under General [[Andrew Jackson]].
<ul>
<li>The [[Treaty of Ghent]] was already signed, but it hadn&rsquo;t made it back home yet. So we won the battle, and the treaty made it to the US a few months after</li>
<li>People thought we won because of this timing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Groups and People Involved:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>[[United States]]:</strong>
<ul>
<li>President [[James Madison]]</li>
<li>General [[Andrew Jackson]]</li>
<li>Tecumseh (Native American leader)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>[[Great Britain]]:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Prime Minister George Canning</li>
<li>General Isaac Brock</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Native American Tribes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Shawnee</li>
<li>Creek</li>
<li>Cherokee</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lasting Impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengthened American nationalism:</strong> The war fostered a sense of unity and pride among Americans.
<ul>
<li>We thought we won because we won the Battle of New Orleans, and a few months later the signed treaty(signed before the battle) finally made it to the US</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Expansion of American territory:</strong> The [[United States]] gained control of the Northwest Territory and strengthened its claim to the [[Florida]] Territory.</li>
<li><strong>Weakening of Native American resistance:</strong> The war undermined Native American alliances with the British and weakened their resistance to American expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Increased military preparedness:</strong> The war led to the establishment of the Coast Guard and the Military Academy at West Point.</li>
<li><strong>Diplomatic resolution:</strong> The [[Treaty of Ghent]] (1814) ended the war and restored pre-war boundaries.</li>
<li><strong>Rise of [[Andrew Jackson]]:</strong> The war made Jackson a national hero and paved the way for his presidency.</li>
<li><strong>[[Era of Good Feelings]]:</strong> The post-war period was characterized by economic prosperity and political harmony.</li>
</ul>
