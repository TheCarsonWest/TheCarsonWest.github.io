<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rebels:</strong>  Approximately 20 enslaved Africans from various West African backgrounds.</li>
<li><strong>Authorities:</strong> South Carolina militia</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A slave rebellion in South Carolina.  Enslaved Africans, many of whom were Kongo,  gathered near the Stono River, armed themselves, and marched south towards Spanish Florida, hoping to gain freedom under Spanish rule (Spanish offered freedom to runaway slaves). Along the way, they killed several white colonists and joined by other enslaved people. The rebellion was eventually put down by South Carolina militia.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Largest slave rebellion in the colonial era:</strong> The scale of the rebellion, although short-lived, shocked the South Carolina colony.</li>
<li><strong>Increased repression of enslaved people:</strong> The rebellion led to the tightening of slave codes in South Carolina and other colonies. This included harsher punishments, restrictions on slave gatherings and movement, and limitations on education for enslaved people. The Negro Act of 1740 was a direct result.</li>
<li><strong>Revealed vulnerabilities of the colonial South:</strong> The rebellion highlighted the constant threat of slave revolts and the underlying social tension in the colony.</li>
<li><strong>Highlighted the brutality of slavery:</strong>  The rebellion demonstrated the desperation of enslaved people and their willingness to risk their lives for freedom.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on relations with Spain:</strong> The Spanish promise of freedom fueled the rebellion and increased tensions between the British colonies and Spain.</li>
