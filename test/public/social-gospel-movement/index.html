<p>A reform movement within Protestantism that applied Christian ethics to social problems.  Advocates believed in the inherent goodness of humanity and sought to improve society through social justice and community action.  They focused on issues like poverty, inequality, and working conditions, often working with labor movements and advocating for better wages, shorter working hours, and improved living conditions.  They believed that true Christian faith required social action and that the Kingdom of God could be achieved on Earth through concerted social efforts.</p>
