<h1 id="conditional-probability">Conditional Probability</h1>
<p>Conditional probability is a fundamental concept in Introduction to Probability that helps us understand how the likelihood of an event changes when we know that another event has already occurred. It&rsquo;s about narrowing down our sample space based on new information.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>Conditional Probability measures the probability of an event (let&rsquo;s call it A) occurring, given that another event (let&rsquo;s call it B) has already occurred. The information that event B has occurred changes the sample space of possible outcomes, potentially altering the probability of event A.</p>
<h2 id="notation-and-formula">Notation and Formula</h2>
<p>The conditional probability of event A given event B is denoted as  $ P(A|B) $ .
The formula for conditional probability is:</p>
<p>$$  P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$<br>
where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ P(A|B) $  is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred.</li>
<li>$ P(A \cap B) $  is the probability that both event A and event B occur (their intersection).</li>
<li>$ P(B) $  is the probability that event B occurs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note</strong>: This formula is only valid when  $ P(B) &gt; 0 $ . If  $ P(B) = 0 $ , then event B is impossible, and we cannot condition on an impossible event.</p>
<p>Similarly, if we want to find the probability of B given A, the formula is:</p>
<p>$$  P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}
$$</p>
<h2 id="understanding-the-formula">Understanding the Formula</h2>
<p>Think of it as revising your sample space. When you know event B has happened, your new &ldquo;universe&rdquo; of possible outcomes is just the outcomes where B occurs. Out of those outcomes, you&rsquo;re interested in the ones where A also occurs. Thus,  $ P(A \cap B) $  represents the part of B where A also happens, and you normalize it by dividing by  $ P(B) $  to get a probability within this new, reduced sample space.</p>
<h2 id="multiplication-rule-for-probability">Multiplication Rule for Probability</h2>
<p>The conditional probability formula can be rearranged to find the probability of the intersection of two events:</p>
<p>$$  P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) \cdot P(B)
$$<br>
or</p>
<p>$$  P(A \cap B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A)
$$<br>
This is known as the <strong>General Multiplication Rule</strong>. It&rsquo;s very useful when you know a conditional probability and the probability of the conditioning event.</p>
<h2 id="example-scenario">Example Scenario</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider a class of 100 students.</p>
<ul>
<li>40 students study Math (M)</li>
<li>30 students study Physics (P)</li>
<li>10 students study both Math and Physics ( $ M \cap P $ )</li>
</ul>
<p>We can create a two-way table for this:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th style="text-align: left"></th>
          <th style="text-align: left">Physics (P)</th>
          <th style="text-align: left">No Physics ( $ P^c $ )</th>
          <th style="text-align: left">Total</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: left">Math (M)</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">10</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">30</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">40</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: left">No Math ( $ M^c $ )</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">20</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">40</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">60</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: left">Total</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">30</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">70</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">100</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>From this, we can calculate probabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ P(M) = 40/100 = 0.4 $</li>
<li>$ P(P) = 30/100 = 0.3 $</li>
<li>$ P(M \cap P) = 10/100 = 0.1 $</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s find the conditional probability that a student studies Math given that they study Physics,  $ P(M|P) $ :</p>
<p>$$  P(M|P) = \frac{P(M \cap P)}{P(P)} = \frac{0.1}{0.3} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333
$$<br>
This means that among the students who study Physics (our new sample space of 30 students), 10 of them also study Math. So,  $ 10/30 = 1/3 $ .</p>
<h2 id="conditional-probability-and-independence">Conditional Probability and Independence</h2>
<p>Conditional probability plays a crucial role in understanding Independent Events and Unions of Events. Two events A and B are considered independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.</p>
<p>Mathematically, A and B are independent if:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ P(A|B) = P(A) $  (knowing B occurred doesn&rsquo;t change A&rsquo;s probability)</li>
<li>$ P(B|A) = P(B) $  (knowing A occurred doesn&rsquo;t change B&rsquo;s probability)</li>
<li>$ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) $  (this is the Multiplication Rule for Independent Events)</li>
</ul>
<p>If these conditions are not met, the events are dependent. In our example above,  $ P(M|P) \approx 0.333 $  and  $ P(M) = 0.4 $ . Since  $ P(M|P) \ne P(M) $ , studying Math and Physics are <strong>dependent events</strong>.</p>
