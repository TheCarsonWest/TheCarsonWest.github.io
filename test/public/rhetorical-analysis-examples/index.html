<p>This note documents examples of rhetorical analysis, categorized for easier reference.  I&rsquo;ll use different types of rhetorical appeals as organizing principles.</p>
<h2 id="logos-logical-appeals">Logos (Logical Appeals)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example [[1]]: Scientific Journal Article.</strong>  Analyzing a scientific journal article requires examining the methodology, data presentation, and conclusions for logical consistency and validity. Key elements to analyze include:
<ul>
<li>$ P \implies Q $  (If P, then Q):  Analyzing the logical structure of arguments presented.</li>
<li>Statistical significance: Assessing the strength of evidence presented.</li>
<li>Potential biases: Identifying any limitations or biases in the research.</li>
<li>[[Scientific Method]]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Example [[2]]: Economic Forecast.</strong> Analyzing an economic forecast involves evaluating the underlying assumptions, data sources, and predictive models used.  Are the projections realistic given current trends?  Are there any overlooked factors?
<ul>
<li>$ GDP_{t+[[1]]} = f(GDP_t, Inflation_t, InterestRates_t) $ :  Examining the model used for forecasting.</li>
<li>[[Economic Modeling]]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pathos-emotional-appeals">Pathos (Emotional Appeals)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example [[1]]: Political Speech.</strong> Analyzing a political speech requires identifying the emotional appeals used to persuade the audience.  What emotions are evoked (e.g., fear, hope, anger)? How are these emotions used to support the speaker&rsquo;s arguments?
<ul>
<li>[[Emotional Appeals in Politics]]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Example [[2]]: Advertisement.</strong>  Advertisements frequently use pathos to influence consumer behavior. Analyzing an advertisement involves identifying the target audience and the emotional techniques used to create desire or a need for the product.
<ul>
<li>[[Advertising Techniques]]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ethos-ethical-appeals">Ethos (Ethical Appeals)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example [[1]]: Testimonial.</strong>  Analyzing a testimonial involves evaluating the credibility and authority of the person providing the endorsement.  What is their expertise? Do they have any potential conflicts of interest?
<ul>
<li>[[Credibility Assessment]]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Example [[2]]: Expert Opinion.</strong> Analyzing an expert opinion requires assessing the expertise and reputation of the source.  Is the expert qualified to offer an opinion on the topic?  Are there any competing perspectives?
<ul>
<li>[[Expert Testimony Analysis]]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="kairos-timing-and-context">Kairos (Timing and Context)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example [[1]]:  News Article.</strong> Analyzing a news article requires considering the context in which it was published (e.g., current events, political climate).  How does the timing and context shape the message and its impact?
<ul>
<li>[[News Media Analysis]]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="combining-appeals">Combining Appeals</h2>
<p>Often, effective rhetoric uses a combination of logos, pathos, and ethos. Analyzing a complex text, like a persuasive essay or a legal brief, often requires identifying and evaluating the interplay of multiple appeals.  For example, a lawyer might use logos to present evidence, pathos to connect with the jury&rsquo;s emotions, and ethos to establish their credibility.  This requires understanding the nuances of how each appeal works in conjunction with the others.  [[Combined Rhetorical Appeals]]</p>
