<h2 id="when-december-7-1941">When: December 7, 1941</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attackers:</strong> Imperial Japanese Navy</li>
<li><strong>Attacked:</strong> <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> Naval Base at Pearl Harbor, <a href="./../hawaii/">Hawaii</a></li>
<li><strong>President:</strong> <a href="./../franklin-d/">Franklin D</a>. Roosevelt (President of the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A surprise military strike conducted by the Imperial Japanese Navy against the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> naval base at Pearl Harbor, <a href="./../hawaii/">Hawaii</a>, on Sunday morning, December 7, 1941. The attack involved two waves of Japanese aircraft, targeting battleships, cruisers, and aircraft. The goal was to cripple the US Pacific Fleet, preventing it from interfering with Japan&rsquo;s planned military actions in Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Entry into WWII:</strong> The attack on Pearl Harbor galvanized American public opinion and led to a formal declaration of war against Japan on December 8, 1941. This marked the official entry of the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> into World War II.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in American Sentiment:</strong> Prior to Pearl Harbor, the US public was largely divided on the issue of intervention in the war. The attack unified the country in support of war against the Axis powers. Isolationist sentiment drastically decreased.</li>
<li><strong>Extensive Damage:</strong> The attack caused significant damage to the US Pacific Fleet, including the sinking or damaging of several battleships, the destruction of numerous aircraft, and the loss of over 2,400 American lives.</li>
<li><strong>Racial Prejudice:</strong> Fueled anti-Japanese sentiment within the US, ultimately contributing to the forced internment of Japanese Americans during the war.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Consequences:</strong> While the attack initially crippled the US Pacific Fleet, it ultimately failed to achieve its long-term strategic goal. The attack united the American people and spurred a massive war effort that ultimately led to Japan&rsquo;s defeat. Aircraft carriers survived the attack and would play a major role in the Pacific Theater.</li>
