<h2 id="1-introduction-to-potential-energy">1. Introduction to Potential Energy</h2>
<p>Potential energy ( $ U $ ) is the energy an object possesses due to its position or configuration within a force field, rather than its motion. It represents stored energy that has the potential to be converted into other forms of energy, such as [[Translational Kinetic Energy]]. Unlike kinetic energy, potential energy is associated with conservative forces.</p>
<p>Potential energy is a [[Scalars and Vectors in One Dimension|scalar]] quantity, measured in Joules (J). The <em>change</em> in potential energy ( $ \Delta U $ ) is often more significant than its absolute value, as it relates directly to the work done by conservative forces.</p>
<h2 id="2-gravitational-potential-energy---u_g--">2. Gravitational Potential Energy ( $ U_g $ )</h2>
<p>Gravitational potential energy is the energy an object possesses due to its position in a gravitational field. For an object near the Earth&rsquo;s surface, it depends on its mass, the acceleration due to gravity, and its height above a chosen reference point.</p>
<h3 id="21-formula-for-gravitational-potential-energy">2.1 Formula for Gravitational Potential Energy</h3>
<p>For an object of mass  $ m $  at a height  $ h $  above a reference level where  $ U_g = 0 $ , the gravitational potential energy is given by:
$  U_g = mgh  $
Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ m $  = mass of the object (kg)</li>
<li>$ g $  = acceleration due to gravity ( $ 9.8 , m/s^2 $  near Earth&rsquo;s surface)</li>
<li>$ h $  = vertical height above the reference level (m)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="22-reference-level">2.2 Reference Level</h3>
<p>The choice of the reference level ( $ h=0 $ ) is arbitrary. What matters is the <em>change</em> in gravitational potential energy ( $ \Delta U_g = mg\Delta h $ ). For example, if an object is lifted from height  $ h_1 $  to  $ h_2 $ , the change in potential energy is  $ mg(h_2 - h_1) $ .</p>
<h2 id="3-elastic-potential-energy---u_s--">3. Elastic Potential Energy ( $ U_s $ )</h2>
<p>Elastic potential energy is the energy stored in an elastic material, such as a spring, when it is stretched or compressed from its equilibrium position. This energy is stored in the bonds of the material and can be released when the material returns to its equilibrium state.</p>
<h3 id="31-formula-for-elastic-potential-energy">3.1 Formula for Elastic Potential Energy</h3>
<p>For an ideal spring with spring constant  $ k $  that is stretched or compressed by a displacement  $ x $  from its equilibrium position, the elastic potential energy is:
$  U_s = \frac{1}{2}kx^2  $
Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ k $  = spring constant (N/m), a measure of the spring&rsquo;s stiffness ([[Spring Forces]])</li>
<li>$ x $  = displacement from the spring&rsquo;s equilibrium position (m)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-conservative-forces-and-potential-energy">4. Conservative Forces and Potential Energy</h2>
<p>Potential energy is only defined for [[Conservative Forces]]. A force is conservative if the work it does on an object moving between two points is independent of the path taken. Alternatively, a conservative force does zero net [[Work]] on an object moving along any closed path.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples of Conservative Forces:</strong> Gravitational force, spring force.</li>
<li><strong>Examples of Non-Conservative Forces:</strong> Friction, air resistance. Work done by non-conservative forces results in a change in the total mechanical energy of a system.</li>
</ul>
<p>The work done by a conservative force is equal to the negative of the change in potential energy:
$  W_c = -\Delta U  $
For instance, the work done by gravity  $ W_g = - (U_{g,f} - U_{g,i}) = U_{g,i} - U_{g,f} $ .</p>
<h2 id="5-relationship-to-work-and-conservation-of-energy">5. Relationship to Work and Conservation of Energy</h2>
<p>Potential energy plays a crucial role in the [[Conservation of Energy]]. In systems where only conservative forces do work, the total mechanical energy ( $ E = K + U $ ) remains constant. When an object moves under the influence of conservative forces, potential energy can be converted into kinetic energy, and vice-versa, while the sum remains constant.</p>
