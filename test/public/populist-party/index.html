<h2 id="when-late-1880s---early-1900s-founded-in-1892-significant-impact-until-early-1900s">When: Late 1880s - early 1900s (Founded in 1892, significant impact until early 1900s)</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Primarily farmers, agricultural laborers, and working-class individuals in the South and West.</li>
<li>Leaders included William Jennings Bryan, Ignatius Donnelly, and Tom Watson.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A political party representing the interests of farmers and laborers in the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>.  They advocated for policies aimed at alleviating economic hardship and addressing issues of industrialization&rsquo;s impact on rural populations.  Key platform elements included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free Silver:</strong>  Advocated for the free and unlimited coinage of silver, believing it would increase the money supply and benefit debtors.</li>
<li><strong>Government Regulation of Railroads:</strong>  Sought government control over railroad rates and practices to prevent exploitation of farmers.</li>
<li><strong>Graduated Income Tax:</strong>  Proposed a progressive income tax system where wealthier individuals pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Election of Senators:</strong>  Called for the direct election of senators by the people, rather than by state legislatures.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Voice for the Agrarian West:</strong> Gave a political voice to farmers and laborers who felt marginalized by industrialization and the existing political system.</li>
<li><strong>Influence on Progressive Era:</strong> Many of the <a href="./../populists/">Populists</a>&rsquo; policy proposals were later adopted by the Progressive movement, demonstrating their lasting impact on American politics.  For example, the direct election of senators and the graduated income tax.</li>
<li><strong>Third Party Influence:</strong> Though unsuccessful in achieving a national victory, the <a href="./../populists/">Populists</a> demonstrated the power of third parties to influence major parties&rsquo; platforms.  The <a href="./../democrats/">Democrats</a> adopted some Populist issues, most notably the free silver platform.</li>
<li><strong>Rise of Bryan:</strong> William Jennings Bryan&rsquo;s campaign for president in 1896, representing the <a href="./../populists/">Populists</a> and <a href="./../democrats/">Democrats</a>, energized the movement and brought national attention to their concerns.  Even in defeat, it significantly changed political discourse.</li>
<li><strong>Decline:</strong> The <a href="./../populist-party/">Populist Party</a> gradually faded after the 1896 election, but its legacy lives on in the progressive reforms of the early 20th century.</li>
