<p>The Chi-Square Test for Goodness of Fit is a powerful statistical tool used to determine if an observed distribution of a categorical variable differs significantly from a hypothesized or expected distribution. Before carrying out the test, it&rsquo;s essential to have properly [[Setting Up a Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test]] by stating hypotheses and defining parameters.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conditions-for-inference">Conditions for Inference</h2>
<p>Before calculating the test statistic and p-value, we must verify that the conditions for performing a Chi-Square Goodness of Fit test are met. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Random</strong>: The data must come from a random sample or a randomized experiment. This ensures that the sample is representative of the population.</li>
<li><strong>Independent</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The individual observations within the sample must be independent of each other.</li>
<li>When sampling without replacement, the sample size  $ n $  must be less than  $ 10% $  of the population size ( $ N $ ). That is,  $ n \le 0.10N $ .</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Large Counts</strong> (Expected Counts): All expected counts must be at least 5. This condition ensures that the  $ \chi^2 $  distribution is a good approximation for the sampling distribution of the test statistic. If this condition is not met for any category, categories may need to be combined, which can alter the hypotheses.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="calculating-the-chi-square-test-statistic">Calculating the Chi-Square Test Statistic</h2>
<p>The Chi-Square ( $ \chi^2 $ ) test statistic measures how far the observed counts deviate from the expected counts. The formula is:</p>
<p>$$  \chi^2 = \sum \frac{(\text{Observed} - \text{Expected})^2}{\text{Expected}}
$$<br>
Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observed (O)</strong>: The actual count for each category from the sample.</li>
<li><strong>Expected (E)</strong>: The count that would be expected for each category if the null hypothesis were true. These are calculated as  $ E = n \times p_i $ , where  $ n $  is the total sample size and  $ p_i $  is the hypothesized proportion for that category. [[Expected Counts in Two-Way Tables]] is a related concept for two-way tables, but here we use the hypothesized proportions.</li>
<li>** $ \sum $ **: Sum of these values over all categories.</li>
</ul>
<p>A larger  $ \chi^2 $  value indicates a greater discrepancy between the observed and expected distributions, providing stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="degrees-of-freedom">Degrees of Freedom</h2>
<p>The degrees of freedom ( $ df $ ) for a Chi-Square Goodness of Fit test are calculated as:</p>
<p>$$  df = \text{number of categories} - 1
$$<br>
The degrees of freedom determine the specific shape of the  $ \chi^2 $  distribution used to calculate the p-value.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="obtaining-the-p-value">Obtaining the P-Value</h2>
<p>Once the  $ \chi^2 $  test statistic and degrees of freedom are calculated, the p-value can be found. The p-value is the probability of observing a  $ \chi^2 $  test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated, assuming the null hypothesis is true.</p>
<p>Since the Chi-Square test is always right-tailed (larger  $ \chi^2 $  values indicate stronger evidence against  $ H_0 $ ), the p-value is the area under the  $ \chi^2 $  distribution curve to the right of the calculated test statistic.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use a calculator&rsquo;s <code> $ \chi^2 $ cdf</code> function (e.g., <code> $ \chi^2 $ cdf(lower_bound =  $ \chi^2 $ _statistic, upper_bound = E99, df)</code>).</li>
<li>Alternatively, statistical software will provide the p-value directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>A small p-value (typically less than the significance level  $ \alpha $ ) suggests that the observed differences are unlikely to have occurred by chance if the null hypothesis were true, leading to rejection of  $ H_0 $ . [[Interpreting p-Values]] provides more detail on this.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The final step is to make a conclusion in the context of the problem, linking back to the null and alternative hypotheses. This involves comparing the p-value to the chosen significance level  $ \alpha $ .</p>
<ul>
<li>**If p-value  $ &lt; \alpha $ **: We reject the null hypothesis ( $ H_0 $ ). There is convincing evidence that the observed distribution of the categorical variable is significantly different from the hypothesized distribution.</li>
<li>**If p-value  $ \ge \alpha $ **: We fail to reject the null hypothesis ( $ H_0 $ ). There is not convincing evidence that the observed distribution of the categorical variable is significantly different from the hypothesized distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that failing to reject  $ H_0 $  does not mean we accept  $ H_0 $ ; it simply means we don&rsquo;t have enough evidence to claim a difference. [[Concluding a Test for a Population Proportion]] offers a general framework for drawing conclusions in hypothesis tests.</p>
