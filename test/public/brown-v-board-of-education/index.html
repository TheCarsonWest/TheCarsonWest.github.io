<h2 id="id-brown-v-board-of-education">ID: Brown v. Board of Education</h2>
<h2 id="when-may-17-1954">When: May 17, 1954</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plaintiffs:</strong> Oliver Brown (on behalf of his daughter Linda Brown) and other African American families</li>
<li><strong>Defendant:</strong> Board of Education of Topeka, [[Kansas]] *   <strong>Supreme Court:</strong> Led by Chief Justice Earl Warren</li>
<li><strong>NAACP:</strong> Thurgood Marshall (lead attorney) and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A landmark Supreme Court case in which the Court declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students unconstitutional, overturning the &ldquo;separate but equal&rdquo; doctrine established in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896). The case consolidated several similar cases from different states.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overturned Plessy v. Ferguson:</strong> Directly challenged and invalidated the legal basis for segregation in public education.</li>
<li><strong>Catalyst for Civil Rights Movement:</strong> Served as a major legal victory and inspiration for the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement. It demonstrated the potential of legal action to dismantle segregation.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation Challenges:</strong> Despite the ruling, desegregation faced massive resistance, especially in the South. This led to further legal battles and federal intervention (e.g., Little Rock Nine).</li>
<li><strong>Expansion of Civil Rights:</strong> The legal arguments used in Brown v. Board were later applied to challenge other forms of segregation and discrimination, extending the scope of civil rights protections.</li>
<li><strong>Equal Protection Clause:</strong> Reinforced the importance of the 14th Amendment&rsquo;s Equal Protection Clause in guaranteeing equal rights and opportunities for all citizens.</li>
