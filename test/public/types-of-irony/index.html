<p>There are three main types of irony:  verbal, situational, and dramatic.  Each has subtle differences.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Verbal Irony:</strong> This involves a discrepancy between what is said and what is meant.  Often sarcastic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Saying &ldquo;Oh, fantastic!&rdquo; after failing an exam.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Situational Irony:</strong> This occurs when the outcome of a situation is the opposite of what is expected.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: A fire station burning down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dramatic Irony:</strong> This happens when the audience or reader knows something that the characters in a story do not. This creates suspense and/or humor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: In a horror movie, the audience sees the killer hiding in the closet, but the character in the movie doesn&rsquo;t.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Further considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cosmic Irony:</strong>  Sometimes considered a subtype of situational irony, this refers to the irony of fate or the universe seemingly working against a character or group. [[Cosmic Irony and Fate]]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Socratic Irony:</strong> A form of verbal irony where someone pretends to be ignorant to draw out information from another. This often involves leading questions. [[Socratic Irony and its Uses]]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ironic Tone:</strong>  The overall feeling or attitude conveyed through the use of irony.  This can be humorous, tragic, or even satirical. [[Ironic Tone Analysis]]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Relationships between Irony Types:</strong>  Sometimes, there&rsquo;s overlap between these types.  For example, a situation can be both dramatically and situationally ironic. [[Overlapping Irony Types]]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mathematical equations related to irony (just kidding!):</strong>   $  \text{Irony} = \frac{\text{Expectation}}{\text{Reality}}  $   (This is a joke, not a real equation)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="--textsarcasm-subseteq-textverbal-irony--">$$  \text{Sarcasm} \subseteq \text{Verbal Irony}  $$</h2>
<p>This equation (also a joke) suggests that sarcasm is a subset of verbal irony.  Many consider sarcasm the most obvious form of verbal irony.</p>
