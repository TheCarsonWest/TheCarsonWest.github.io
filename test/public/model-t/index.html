<h2 id="when-june-28-1919-signed-ratification-debate-in-us-senate-1919-1920">When: June 28, 1919 (signed); Ratification debate in US Senate, 1919-1920</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./../allied-powers/">Allied Powers</a>:</strong> Primarily <a href="./../great-britain/">Great Britain</a>, <a href="./../france/">France</a>, Italy, and the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> (though the US did not ratify it)</li>
<li><strong>Germany:</strong> Forced to accept the terms of the treaty.</li>
<li><strong>President <a href="./../woodrow-wilson/">Woodrow Wilson</a>:</strong> Leading advocate for the treaty and the <a href="./../league-of-nations/">League of Nations</a>, but failed to get US support.</li>
<li><strong>Henry Cabot Lodge:</strong> Republican Senator and leader of the opposition to the treaty in the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>The <a href="./../treaty-of-versailles/">Treaty of Versailles</a> was the peace treaty that officially ended World War I. It imposed harsh terms on Germany, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Territorial Losses:</strong> Germany lost significant territory in Europe and all of its overseas colonies.</li>
<li><strong>Military Restrictions:</strong> Severe limitations were placed on the size and capabilities of the German military.</li>
<li><strong>Reparations:</strong> Germany was required to pay enormous reparations to the Allied powers for war damages.</li>
<li><strong>War Guilt Clause (Article 231):</strong> Germany was forced to accept full responsibility for causing the war.</li>
<li><strong><a href="./../league-of-nations/">League of Nations</a>:</strong> The treaty established the <a href="./../league-of-nations/">League of Nations</a>, an international organization intended to prevent future wars through diplomacy and collective security.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seeds of Future Conflict:</strong> The treaty&rsquo;s harsh terms and perceived injustices fueled resentment and instability in Germany, contributing to the rise of extremist ideologies and ultimately to World War II.</li>
<li><strong>US Rejection:</strong> The US Senate refused to ratify the treaty, primarily due to concerns about the <a href="./../league-of-nations/">League of Nations</a> infringing on American sovereignty and the potential for being drawn into future European conflicts. Led by Henry Cabot Lodge, the Senate wanted to retain the power to declare war and avoid entangling alliances.</li>
<li><strong><a href="./../league-of-nations/">League of Nations</a> Weakened:</strong> The absence of the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>, a major world power, significantly weakened the <a href="./../league-of-nations/">League of Nations</a> and its ability to effectively address international crises.</li>
<li><strong>Isolationist Sentiment in the US:</strong> The rejection of the treaty reflected a growing sentiment of isolationism in the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> after WWI, as Americans sought to focus on domestic issues and avoid foreign entanglements.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in Global Power:</strong> The <a href="./../treaty-of-versailles/">Treaty of Versailles</a> and its aftermath marked a shift in global power dynamics, with Europe weakened and the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> emerging as a leading economic and political force.</li>
