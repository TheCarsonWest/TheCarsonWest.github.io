<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Congress:</strong> Passed the act.</li>
<li><strong>President <a href="./../chester-a/">Chester A</a>. Arthur:</strong> Signed the act into law.</li>
<li><strong>Target Population:</strong> Chinese immigrants in the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<h1 id="10-years">10 years</h1>
<p>The <a href="./../chinese-exclusion-act/">Chinese Exclusion Act</a> was a <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> federal law that prohibited all immigration of Chinese laborers.  It was initially enacted for ten years, and was periodically renewed until its repeal in 1943.  The act also barred Chinese from becoming naturalized citizens.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nativism and <a href="./../xenophobia/">Xenophobia</a>:</strong> The act exemplified growing nativism and anti-immigrant sentiment in the late 19th century <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>.  It reflected fears about competition for jobs and cultural differences.</li>
<li><strong>Discrimination and Racism:</strong> The act was a landmark example of legal discrimination against a specific racial group.  It targeted Chinese immigrants based on their ethnicity and contributed to a long history of anti-Chinese sentiment in America.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Immigration:</strong> The act drastically reduced Chinese immigration to the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>, effectively sealing off a major source of immigration from Asia.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Impacts:</strong> The act&rsquo;s legacy continues to influence discussions about immigration policy, racial justice, and the treatment of minority groups in the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>.  It serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of discriminatory legislation.</li>
<li><strong>Formation of Chinese American Communities:</strong> While significantly restricting immigration, the Act also led to the development of tightly-knit Chinese American communities focused on mutual support and self-reliance.  This resulted in distinct cultural enclaves in American cities.</li>
