The split in the Republican party between Taft and Roosevelt allowed Wilson to win a decisive victory.  Each candidate represented a distinct ideology: Taft represented conservative <a href="./../republicans/">Republicans</a>, Roosevelt represented progressive <a href="./../republicans/">Republicans</a>, Wilson represented the progressive <a href="./../democrats/">Democrats</a>, and Debs represented the Socialist movement.</h2>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Progressive Era&rsquo;s Influence:</strong> The election highlighted the growing power of the progressive movement and its impact on American politics. The Progressive platform of Roosevelt and Wilson dominated the discussion.</li>
<li><strong>End of Republican Dominance:</strong> The split in the Republican party marked the end of their era of dominance and ushered in the Progressive Era under Wilson.</li>
<li><strong>Wilson&rsquo;s Presidency:</strong> Wilson&rsquo;s victory led to the implementation of his progressive agenda, including the Underwood Tariff Act, the Federal Reserve Act, and the <a href="./../clayton-antitrust-act/">Clayton Antitrust Act</a>.  His presidency, significantly shaped by this win, profoundly impacted American society and the economy.</li>
<li><strong>Third-Party Influence:</strong> Debs&rsquo;s relatively strong showing demonstrated the growing support for socialist ideas and the potential for third-party movements to influence national politics.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in Political Landscape:</strong> The election fundamentally reshaped the American political landscape, setting the stage for the progressive reforms that would characterize the next decade and influence the country&rsquo;s development leading up to and during WWI.</li>
