<h2 id="id-judiciary-act-of-1789">ID: [[Judiciary Act]] of 1789</h2>
<h2 id="when-september-24-1789">When: September 24, 1789</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Proposed by: Congressman Oliver Ellsworth of [[Connecticut]]</li>
<li>Signed into law by: President [[George [[Washington]]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>Established a federal court system for the newly formed [[United States]] under the Constitution. The Act outlined a three-tiered system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supreme Court:</strong>  Comprised of a Chief Justice and five Associate Justices.</li>
<li><strong>Circuit Courts:</strong> Three circuit courts were created to handle appeals from the district courts.</li>
<li><strong>District Courts:</strong>  Thirteen district courts, one for each state at the time, served as the primary trial courts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Act also granted the Supreme Court the power of judicial review for certain cases, though this power wasn&rsquo;t explicitly defined until the landmark <em>Marbury v. Madison</em> case in 1803.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact? Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Established a Foundation:</strong> Provided a crucial framework for the federal judiciary, outlining its structure, jurisdiction, and procedures. This was essential for the new government to function effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthened Federal Power:</strong>  By establishing a separate federal court system, the Act contributed to the growth of federal power and influence relative to the states.</li>
<li><strong>Source of Debate and Evolution:</strong> The Act&rsquo;s provisions, particularly those related to judicial review and the balance of power between state and federal courts, have been the subject of ongoing debate and interpretation throughout American history.</li>
