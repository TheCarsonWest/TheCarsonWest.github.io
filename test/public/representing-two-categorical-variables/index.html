<p>When we collect data on two categorical variables for the same individuals, we often want to explore the relationship between these variables. This involves organizing and displaying the data in a way that allows us to identify patterns and associations. This page focuses on how to effectively represent this type of data.</p>
<h2 id="two-way-tables-contingency-tables">Two-Way Tables (Contingency Tables)</h2>
<p>The primary tool for representing the relationship between two categorical variables is a [[Two-Way Table]]. Also known as a contingency table, it displays counts (or frequencies) of observations for each combination of categories for the two variables.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structure</strong>:
<ul>
<li>One categorical variable&rsquo;s categories form the <strong>rows</strong> of the table.</li>
<li>The other categorical variable&rsquo;s categories form the <strong>columns</strong> of the table.</li>
<li>The entries in the cells of the table are the <strong>counts</strong> of individuals who fall into that specific combination of categories.</li>
<li><strong>Row totals</strong> and <strong>column totals</strong> provide the [[Marginal Distribution]] for each variable separately.</li>
<li>The <strong>grand total</strong> (bottom right corner) is the total number of individuals in the study.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-opinion-on-a-new-policy-by-gender">Example: Opinion on a New Policy by Gender</h3>
<p>Consider a survey asking students about their opinion on a new school policy (Support, Oppose, Neutral) and their gender (Male, Female).</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th style="text-align: left"></th>
          <th style="text-align: left">Support</th>
          <th style="text-align: left">Oppose</th>
          <th style="text-align: left">Neutral</th>
          <th style="text-align: left">Total</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: left"><strong>Male</strong></td>
          <td style="text-align: left">50</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">30</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">20</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">100</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: left"><strong>Female</strong></td>
          <td style="text-align: left">40</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">60</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">10</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">110</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: left"><strong>Total</strong></td>
          <td style="text-align: left">90</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">90</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">30</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">210</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>From this table, we can see, for instance, that 50 males supported the policy. There were 100 males surveyed in total, and 90 students supported the policy overall.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-relative-frequencies">Types of Relative Frequencies</h2>
<p>While counts are useful, converting them to relative frequencies (proportions or percentages) allows for easier comparison, especially when group sizes are different.</p>
<h3 id="1-joint-relative-frequencies">1. Joint Relative Frequencies</h3>
<p>These are the proportions of individuals that fall into specific combinations of categories relative to the <strong>grand total</strong>. They tell us the proportion of all individuals in the study that share two specific characteristics.</p>
<p>$$  \text{Joint Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Count in cell}}{\text{Grand Total}}  $$</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Example</em>: The proportion of students who are male AND support the policy:  $ 50 / 210 \approx 0.238 $  (or 23.8%).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-marginal-relative-frequencies">2. Marginal Relative Frequencies</h3>
<p>These are the proportions of individuals that fall into one category of a single variable, relative to the <strong>grand total</strong>. They are found by dividing the row or column totals by the grand total. These represent the [[Marginal Distribution]] for each variable.</p>
<p>$$  \text{Marginal Relative Frequency (Row)} = \frac{\text{Row Total}}{\text{Grand Total}}  $$   $$  \text{Marginal Relative Frequency (Column)} = \frac{\text{Column Total}}{\text{Grand Total}}  $$</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Example</em>: The proportion of all students who are female:  $ 110 / 210 \approx 0.524 $  (or 52.4%).</li>
<li><em>Example</em>: The proportion of all students who oppose the policy:  $ 90 / 210 \approx 0.429 $  (or 42.9%).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-conditional-relative-frequencies">3. Conditional Relative Frequencies</h3>
<p>[[Conditional Relative Frequencies]] tell us the proportion of individuals with a specific characteristic <em>within a particular subgroup</em>. They are crucial for investigating relationships between the two variables, as they allow us to compare distributions across different categories of one variable.</p>
<p>$$  \text{Conditional Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Count in cell}}{\text{Marginal Total of the conditioning variable}}  $$</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Conditioning on one variable</strong>: To see if opinion <em>depends</em> on gender, we would look at the distribution of opinion <em>within</em> each gender.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Example</em>: Proportion of males who support the policy:  $ 50 / 100 = 0.50 $  (or 50%).</li>
<li><em>Example</em>: Proportion of females who support the policy:  $ 40 / 110 \approx 0.364 $  (or 36.4%).</li>
<li>Comparing these (50% vs. 36.4%) suggests a difference in opinion between genders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conditioning on the other variable</strong>: To see if gender <em>depends</em> on opinion, we would look at the distribution of gender <em>within</em> each opinion category.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Example</em>: Proportion of those who support the policy who are male:  $ 50 / 90 \approx 0.556 $  (or 55.6%).</li>
<li><em>Example</em>: Proportion of those who support the policy who are female:  $ 40 / 90 \approx 0.444 $  (or 44.4%).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By comparing these conditional distributions, we can assess whether there&rsquo;s an association or [[Independence (Categorical Variables)]] between the two categorical variables. If the conditional distributions are similar, there might be little to no association. If they are different, an association likely exists.</p>
<p>For more on analyzing these relationships, refer to [[Statistics for Two Categorical Variables]]. While not extensively covered in AP Statistics, graphical representations like segmented bar charts can visually display conditional distributions, similar to how [[Representing a Categorical Variable with Graphs]] handles single categorical variables.</p>
