<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Delegates from twelve of the thirteen colonies (<a href="./../georgia/">Georgia</a> did not attend).  Represented a broad spectrum of colonial society, including merchants, lawyers, planters, and some artisans.  Key figures included Patrick Henry, <a href="./../samuel-adams/">Samuel Adams</a>, <a href="./../john-adams/">John Adams</a>, George <a href="./../washington/">Washington</a>, and Joseph Galloway.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>The <a href="./../first-continental-congress/">First Continental Congress</a> was a meeting of delegates from twelve of the thirteen British colonies in North America.  It was convened in response to the <a href="./../intolerable-acts/">Intolerable Acts</a>, a series of punitive measures imposed by the British government after the <a href="./../boston-tea-party/">Boston Tea Party</a>.  The Congress aimed to address colonial grievances against British policies and coordinate a unified response.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Declaration of Rights and Grievances:</strong> The Congress issued a Declaration of Rights and Grievances, outlining colonial rights and protesting against British policies like taxation without representation and the quartering of troops.  This document articulated a formal opposition to British rule.</li>
<li><strong>Establishment of the Continental Association:</strong> The Congress created the Continental Association, a system of boycotts against British goods. This economic pressure was intended to force Britain to reconsider its policies.</li>
<li><strong>Call for a Second Congress:</strong>  Recognizing the need for continued unity and action, the Congress agreed to reconvene if grievances were not addressed. This laid the groundwork for further colonial resistance.</li>
<li><strong>Show of Colonial Unity:</strong>  The Congress demonstrated a significant level of intercolonial cooperation and coordination, foreshadowing the eventual move towards independence. The very act of convening represented a powerful challenge to British authority.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in Colonial Sentiment:</strong> The Congress marked a crucial shift in colonial sentiment. While not initially advocating for independence, it set the stage for more radical actions in the coming years.</li>
