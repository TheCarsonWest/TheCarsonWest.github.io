<li><strong>Post-War Era &amp; the Beginning of the Cold War:</strong>

<li><strong>Marshall Plan (1948):</strong>  Massive economic aid package to help rebuild Western Europe after WWII, aimed at preventing the spread of communism by fostering economic stability.</li>
<li><strong>Berlin Blockade and Airlift (1948-1949):</strong>  The Soviet Union blocked access to West Berlin; Truman ordered a massive airlift of supplies to sustain the city until the blockade was lifted. A defining moment of the early Cold War.</li>
