<h2 id="id-civil-rights-act-of-1964">ID: Civil Rights Act of 1964</h2>
<h2 id="when-july-2-1964">When: July 2, 1964</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>President:</strong> Lyndon B. Johnson (signed the bill into law)</li>
<li><strong>Key Supporters:</strong> Civil Rights Activists (Martin Luther King Jr., etc.), members of Congress from both parties (though faced significant opposition, especially from Southern Democrats).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>Landmark legislation that outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Banned discrimination in public accommodations (hotels, restaurants, theaters, etc.).</li>
<li>Prohibited discrimination in employment based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to enforce this.</li>
<li>Strengthened voting rights provisions.</li>
<li>Allowed the federal government to file lawsuits to desegregate schools.</li>
<li>Authorized the termination of federal funding to programs that discriminated.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legal Foundation for Equality:</strong> Provided a strong legal basis for challenging discrimination and advancing civil rights.</li>
<li><strong>End of Jim Crow:</strong> Significantly weakened Jim Crow laws and practices in the South.</li>
<li><strong>Expanded Opportunities:</strong> Opened up opportunities in employment, education, and public accommodations for African Americans and other minority groups.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Political Participation:</strong> Contributed to increased African American voter registration and political participation.</li>
<li><strong>Continuing Struggle:</strong> While a monumental achievement, the Act did not eliminate racism or discrimination entirely. The Civil Rights Movement continued to address issues such as economic inequality and systemic racism. The Act laid the groundwork for future civil rights legislation, such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</li>
