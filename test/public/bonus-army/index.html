<h2 id="id-bonus-army">ID: [[Bonus Army]]</h2>
<h2 id="when-may---july-1932">When: May - July 1932</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>World War I Veterans:</strong> Organized and led by figures like Walter W. Waters.</li>
<li><strong>President [[Herbert Hoover]]:</strong> The president at the time of the protests.</li>
<li><strong>General Douglas MacArthur:</strong> Led the military operation to disperse the [[Bonus Army]].</li>
<li><strong>[[Dwight D]]. Eisenhower:</strong> Served as MacArthur&rsquo;s aide during the dispersal.</li>
<li><strong>George S. Patton:</strong> Commanded the 3rd Cavalry Regiment during the dispersal.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A group of approximately 43,000 demonstrators – made up of 17,000 U.S. World War I veterans, together with their families and affiliated groups – who gathered in [[Washington]], D.C. in the spring and summer of 1932 to demand immediate cash payment of their certificates of service (promised bonuses) which were scheduled to be paid out in 1945. They camped in makeshift shantytowns and protested peacefully. Congress rejected their demands. Hoover ordered the army to forcibly evict the veterans, leading to clashes, injuries, and deaths.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Perception of Hoover:</strong> The violent dispersal of the [[Bonus Army]] severely damaged President Hoover&rsquo;s reputation, further eroding public confidence in his ability to handle the [[Great Depression]].</li>
<li><strong>Increased Discontent:</strong> Highlighted the desperation and suffering caused by the [[Great Depression]] and fueled public anger towards the government&rsquo;s perceived inaction.</li>
<li><strong>Election of FDR:</strong> Contributed to Hoover&rsquo;s defeat in the 1932 election and paved the way for [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]&rsquo;s [[New Deal]].</li>
<li><strong>Shift in Government Responsibility:</strong> The event helped push the narrative of the government needing to assist/care for citizens in desperate economic need.</li>
<li><strong>Symbol of Economic Hardship:</strong> Became a symbol of the widespread poverty and unemployment during the [[Great Depression]].</li>
