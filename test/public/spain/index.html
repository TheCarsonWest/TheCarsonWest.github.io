<p><strong>Early Exploration and Colonization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1492:</strong> Christopher Columbus, funded by [[Spain]], reaches the Americas, marking the beginning of European colonization in the Western Hemisphere.</li>
<li><strong>1513:</strong> Juan Ponce de Le√≥n claims [[Florida]] for [[Spain]], establishing the first European claim in what is now the continental [[United States]].</li>
<li><strong>1565:</strong> St. Augustine, [[Florida]], is founded by [[Spain]], becoming the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in the continental U.S.</li>
<li><strong>16th-18th Centuries:</strong> [[Spain]] establishes missions and settlements throughout the Southwest ([[California]], [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], [[Texas]]), influencing the development of these regions with their culture, language, and [[religion]].</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conflict and Shifting Power:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1763:</strong>  Following the Seven Years&rsquo; War, [[Spain]] cedes [[Florida]] to [[Great Britain]] in exchange for Cuba. This marks the beginning of a decline in Spanish influence in North America.</li>
<li><strong>1783:</strong> The Treaty of Paris, ending the American Revolutionary War, returns [[Florida]] to Spanish control. However, [[Spain]]&rsquo;s hold on the region weakens due to internal struggles and pressure from the newly formed [[United States]].</li>
<li><strong>1800:</strong> [[Spain]] cedes [[Louisiana]] back to [[France]] in a secret treaty. This sets the stage for the [[Louisiana]] Purchase in 1803, which dramatically expands the territory of the [[United States]].</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The End of Spanish Rule and Lasting Legacy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1819:</strong>  [[Spain]] cedes [[Florida]] to the [[United States]] through the [[Adams-Onis Treaty]], ending Spanish territorial claims in North America.</li>
<li><strong>1898:</strong> The [[Spanish-American War]] erupts, fueled by tensions over Cuba. The decisive American victory leads to the end of Spanish colonialism and the rise of the [[United States]] as a global power.</li>
