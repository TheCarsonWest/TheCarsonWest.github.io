<p><a href="./../differentiability/">Differentiability</a>, a cornerstone concept in Calculus AB, essentially describes whether a function has a well-defined <a href="./../derivative/">derivative</a> at a specific point.  It&rsquo;s closely tied to the idea of a smooth, continuous curve.  A function is differentiable at a point if its graph has a tangent line at that point.  This means the function must be both continuous and smooth at that point. Let&rsquo;s break down the key aspects:</p>
<h2 id="1-the-definition-of-the-derivativederivative">1. The Definition of the <a href="./../derivative/">Derivative</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="./../derivative/">derivative</a> of a function  $ f(x) $  at a point  $ x=a $ , denoted as  $ f&rsquo;(a) $ , is defined as:</p>
<p>$ f&rsquo;(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} $</p>
<p>This limit represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph of  $ f(x) $  at  $ x=a $ .  If this limit exists, the function is differentiable at  $ x=a $ .</p>
<h2 id="2--relationship-to-continuitycontinuity">2.  Relationship to <a href="./../continuity/">Continuity</a></h2>
<p><a href="./../continuity/">Continuity</a></p>
<p>A function must be continuous at a point to be differentiable at that point. However, <a href="./../continuity/">continuity</a> alone is not sufficient for differentiability.  A function can be continuous at a point but not differentiable there.</p>
<h2 id="3-conditions-for-non-differentiabilitydifferentiability">3. Conditions for Non-<a href="./../differentiability/">Differentiability</a></h2>
<p>A function is not differentiable at a point if any of the following occur:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharp Corner/Cusp:</strong> The function has a sharp turn or cusp at the point.  The slope of the tangent line approaches different values from the left and right.</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-desmos-graph" data-lang="desmos-graph">y = abs(x)
</code></pre><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Vertical Tangent:</strong> The function has a vertical tangent line at the point. The slope of the tangent line approaches infinity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discontinuity:</strong> The function is discontinuous (has a jump, hole, or asymptote) at the point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-desmos-graph" data-lang="desmos-graph">y = 1/(x-1)
{x&gt;1}
y = 2
{x=1}
y = x
{x&lt;1}
</code></pre><ul>
<li><strong>Oscillating Function:</strong> The function oscillates infinitely rapidly near the point.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4--differentiabilitydifferentiability-and-smoothness">4.  <a href="./../differentiability/">Differentiability</a> and Smoothness</h2>
<p><a href="./../differentiability/">Differentiability</a> implies smoothness.  A differentiable function will have a smooth, continuous curve without any sharp corners, cusps, or vertical tangents. However, the converse is not always true (a function can be smooth but not differentiable everywhere).</p>
<p><a href="./../higher-order-derivatives/">Higher Order Derivatives</a></p>
<h2 id="5--practical-applications">5.  Practical Applications</h2>
<p><a href="./../differentiability/">Differentiability</a> is crucial for many applications in Calculus AB, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finding instantaneous rates of change:</strong> The <a href="./../derivative/">derivative</a> gives the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a specific point.</li>
<li><strong>Optimization problems:</strong> Finding maximum and minimum values of a function often involves analyzing its <a href="./../derivative/">derivative</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Related rates problems:</strong>  Using derivatives to relate the rates of change of different variables.</li>
<li><strong>Curve sketching:</strong>  The <a href="./../derivative/">derivative</a> helps determine the increasing/decreasing intervals and concavity of a function.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6--checking-for-differentiabilitydifferentiability">6.  Checking for <a href="./../differentiability/">Differentiability</a></h2>
<p>To determine if a function is differentiable at a point, you typically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check for <a href="./../continuity/">continuity</a> at the point.</li>
<li>Calculate the left-hand and right-hand derivatives using the limit definition.</li>
<li>If the left-hand and right-hand derivatives are equal and finite, the function is differentiable at the point.</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, differentiability is a crucial concept in Calculus AB that connects the idea of a function&rsquo;s slope to its smoothness and <a href="./../continuity/">continuity</a>. Understanding the conditions for differentiability and non-differentiability is essential for mastering many important calculus concepts and applications.</p>
