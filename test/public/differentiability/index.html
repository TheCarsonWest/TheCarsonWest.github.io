<p>[[Differentiability]], a cornerstone concept in Calculus AB, essentially describes whether a function has a well-defined [[derivative]] at a specific point.  It&rsquo;s closely tied to the idea of a smooth, continuous curve.  A function is differentiable at a point if its graph has a tangent line at that point.  This means the function must be both continuous and smooth at that point. Let&rsquo;s break down the key aspects:</p>
<h2 id="1-the-definition-of-the-derivative">1. The Definition of the [[Derivative]]</h2>
<p>The [[derivative]] of a function  $ f(x) $  at a point  $ x=a $ , denoted as  $ f&rsquo;(a) $ , is defined as:</p>
<p>$ f&rsquo;(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} $</p>
<p>This limit represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph of  $ f(x) $  at  $ x=a $ .  If this limit exists, the function is differentiable at  $ x=a $ .</p>
<h2 id="2--relationship-to-continuity">2.  Relationship to [[Continuity]]</h2>
<p>[[Continuity]]</p>
<p>A function must be continuous at a point to be differentiable at that point. However, [[continuity]] alone is not sufficient for differentiability.  A function can be continuous at a point but not differentiable there.</p>
<h2 id="3-conditions-for-non-differentiability">3. Conditions for Non-[[Differentiability]]</h2>
<p>A function is <em>not</em> differentiable at a point if any of the following occur:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharp Corner/Cusp:</strong> The function has a sharp turn or cusp at the point.  The slope of the tangent line approaches different values from the left and right.</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-desmos-graph" data-lang="desmos-graph">y = abs(x)
</code></pre><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Vertical Tangent:</strong> The function has a vertical tangent line at the point. The slope of the tangent line approaches infinity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discontinuity:</strong> The function is discontinuous (has a jump, hole, or asymptote) at the point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-desmos-graph" data-lang="desmos-graph">y = 1/(x-1)
{x&gt;1}
y = 2
{x=1}
y = x
{x&lt;1}
</code></pre><ul>
<li><strong>Oscillating Function:</strong> The function oscillates infinitely rapidly near the point.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4--differentiability-and-smoothness">4.  [[Differentiability]] and Smoothness</h2>
<p>[[Differentiability]] implies smoothness.  A differentiable function will have a smooth, continuous curve without any sharp corners, cusps, or vertical tangents. However, the converse is not always true (a function can be smooth but not differentiable everywhere).</p>
<p>[[Higher Order Derivatives]]</p>
<h2 id="5--practical-applications">5.  Practical Applications</h2>
<p>[[Differentiability]] is crucial for many applications in Calculus AB, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finding instantaneous rates of change:</strong> The [[derivative]] gives the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a specific point.</li>
<li><strong>Optimization problems:</strong> Finding maximum and minimum values of a function often involves analyzing its [[derivative]].</li>
<li><strong>Related rates problems:</strong>  Using derivatives to relate the rates of change of different variables.</li>
<li><strong>Curve sketching:</strong>  The [[derivative]] helps determine the increasing/decreasing intervals and concavity of a function.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6--checking-for-differentiability">6.  Checking for [[Differentiability]]</h2>
<p>To determine if a function is differentiable at a point, you typically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check for [[continuity]] at the point.</li>
<li>Calculate the left-hand and right-hand derivatives using the limit definition.</li>
<li>If the left-hand and right-hand derivatives are equal and finite, the function is differentiable at the point.</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, differentiability is a crucial concept in Calculus AB that connects the idea of a function&rsquo;s slope to its smoothness and [[continuity]]. Understanding the conditions for differentiability and non-differentiability is essential for mastering many important calculus concepts and applications.</p>
