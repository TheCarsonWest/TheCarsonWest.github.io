<h1 id="the-normal-distribution">The Normal Distribution</h1>
<p>The Normal Distribution is one of the most important and widely used probability distributions in statistics. It&rsquo;s often referred to as the &ldquo;bell curve&rdquo; due to its characteristic symmetric, unimodal shape. Many natural phenomena and sampling distributions approximate a normal distribution, making it a crucial tool for statistical inference.</p>
<h2 id="characteristics-of-the-normal-distribution">Characteristics of the Normal Distribution</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Symmetry</strong>: The distribution is perfectly symmetric around its mean ( $ \mu $ ). This means the mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center of the curve.</li>
<li>[[Unimodal]]: It has a single peak.</li>
<li><strong>Asymptotic</strong>: The tails of the distribution extend indefinitely in both directions, approaching, but never quite touching, the horizontal axis.</li>
<li><strong>Defined by two parameters</strong>: A specific normal distribution is completely described by its mean ( $ \mu $ ) and standard deviation ( $ \sigma $ ).
<ul>
<li>The mean ( $ \mu $ ) determines the center of the distribution.</li>
<li>The standard deviation ( $ \sigma $ ) determines the spread or variability of the distribution. A larger  $ \sigma $  means a wider, flatter curve, while a smaller  $ \sigma $  means a narrower, taller curve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The probability density function (PDF) for a normal distribution is given by:
$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2} $$  While you won&rsquo;t typically need to use this formula in AP Statistics, it illustrates how the mean and standard deviation define the curve.</p>
<h2 id="the-empirical-rule-68-95-997-rule">The Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 Rule)</h2>
<p>A key feature of the normal distribution is the predictable proportion of data that falls within certain standard deviation ranges from the mean. This is known as the Empirical Rule:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th style="text-align: left">Range of Standard Deviations</th>
          <th style="text-align: left">Approximate Percentage of Data</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: left">$ \mu \pm 1\sigma $</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">68%</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: left">$ \mu \pm 2\sigma $</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">95%</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: left">$ \mu \pm 3\sigma $</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">99.7%</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>This rule is incredibly useful for quickly estimating probabilities or proportions for normally distributed data without complex calculations. For example, if test scores are normally distributed with a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of 5, approximately 95% of students scored between 60 and 80 (70  $ \pm $  2 * 5).</p>
<h2 id="standardizing-normal-distributions-z-scores">[[Standardizing Normal Distributions]] (Z-Scores)</h2>
<p>To compare values from different normal distributions or to find probabilities for values not covered by the Empirical Rule, we convert observations to a standard scale using a [[z-score]]. A z-score measures how many standard deviations an observation is away from the mean.</p>
<p>The formula for a z-score is:
$$ z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} $$  Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ x $  is the individual observation</li>
<li>$ \mu $  is the mean of the distribution</li>
<li>$ \sigma $  is the standard deviation of the distribution</li>
</ul>
<p>A positive z-score indicates the observation is above the mean, while a negative z-score indicates it&rsquo;s below the mean.</p>
<h2 id="the-standard-normal-distribution">The Standard Normal Distribution</h2>
<p>When an observation has been standardized using the z-score formula, it comes from a special normal distribution called the <strong>Standard Normal Distribution</strong>. This distribution has a mean of 0 ( $ \mu = 0 $ ) and a standard deviation of 1 ( $ \sigma = 1 $ ). Its probability density function is often denoted as  $ \phi(z) $ .</p>
<p>Using the standard normal distribution, we can find the proportion of observations falling below, above, or between any given values. This is typically done using:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Z-tables</strong>: These tables provide the cumulative proportion (area to the left) for various z-scores.</li>
<li><strong>Calculators/Software</strong>: Most graphing calculators (e.g., TI-83/84) have functions like <code>normalcdf</code> (normal cumulative distribution function) to calculate probabilities for any normal distribution, or specifically for the standard normal distribution.</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding the normal distribution is fundamental, as it underpins many inferential procedures discussed later in AP Statistics, especially when dealing with [[Sampling Distributions for Sample Means]] and [[Sampling Distributions for Sample Proportions]]. For a deeper dive into its applications and how it relates to sampling, refer to [[The Normal Distribution, Revisited]] and [[The Central Limit Theorem]].</p>
