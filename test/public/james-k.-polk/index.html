<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>James K. Polk (1795-1849) was the 11th POTUS, serving from 1845 to 1849. A staunch Democrat, he is often remembered for his expansionist policies and commitment to <strong>Manifest Destiny</strong>. His presidency led to significant territorial growth for the United States, but also exacerbated the issue of slavery and sectional tensions that eventually contributed to the Civil War.</p>
<h2 id="key-events--policies">Key Events &amp; Policies</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Election of 1844:</strong> Polk ran against Henry Clay of the Whig party. Polk&rsquo;s platform centered around the annexation of Texas and the acquisition of Oregon. His victory was seen as a mandate for westward expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Annexation of Texas (1845):</strong> Texas, which had declared independence from Mexico in 1836, was formally annexed into the United States. This act angered the Mexican government and became a major point of contention.</li>
<li><strong>Oregon Treaty (1846):</strong> Polk negotiated a treaty with Great Britain establishing the 49th parallel as the boundary between the United States and British Canada in the Oregon Territory. This resolved a long-standing dispute over the territory.</li>
<li><strong>Mexican-American War (1846-1848):</strong> Border disputes in Texas led to armed conflict with Mexico. Polk believed that Mexico initiated the conflict. The war resulted in a decisive victory for the United States and significant territorial gains.</li>
<li><strong>Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848):</strong> This treaty ended the Mexican-American War. Mexico ceded a vast amount of territory to the United States, including California, Nevada, Utah, and parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming. The United States paid Mexico  $ 15 million.</li>
<li><strong>Walker Tariff (1846):</strong> Polk oversaw the passage of the Walker Tariff, which significantly lowered tariff rates. This was a major victory for Southern agricultural interests who opposed high tariffs that protected Northern manufacturers.</li>
<li><strong>Independent Treasury System:</strong> Polk re-established the Independent Treasury system, which stored government funds in subtreasuries rather than in private banks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="important-legislation">Important Legislation</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Walker Tariff (1846):</strong> Reduced tariff rates.</li>
<li>Legislation related to the establishment of the Independent Treasury System.</li>
<li>Legislation authorizing the declaration of war against Mexico.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="groups-and-affiliations">Groups and Affiliations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Democratic Party</strong>: Polk was a dedicated Democrat and a protege of Andrew Jackson.</li>
<li>Supported by Southern planters and those favoring westward expansion.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-on-the-country">Impact on the Country</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Territorial Expansion</strong>: Polk oversaw the largest expansion of US territory since the Louisiana Purchase. This fueled the idea of <strong>Manifest Destiny</strong> and solidified the United States&rsquo; position as a continental power.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Sectionalism</strong>: The newly acquired territories intensified the debate over slavery. The question of whether slavery would be allowed in these territories led to increased tensions between the North and South, ultimately contributing to the Civil War.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Growth</strong>: The acquisition of new lands and resources spurred economic growth. Lower tariff rates under the Walker Tariff stimulated international trade.</li>
<li><strong>Controversy</strong>: Polk&rsquo;s actions, especially regarding the Mexican-American War, were highly controversial. Critics accused him of provoking the war to acquire territory for the expansion of slavery.</li>
<li><strong>Setting a Precedent:</strong> Polk set a precedent by committing to only one term as president. This commitment to term limits solidified as a characteristic of the executive office.</li>
