<h2 id="when-1950-1953-june-25-1950---july-27-1953">WHEN: 1950-1953 (June 25, 1950 - July 27, 1953)</h2>
<h2 id="who">WHO:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>North Korea:</strong> Supported by the Soviet Union and China, led by Kim Il-sung.</li>
<li><strong>South Korea:</strong> Supported by the [[United States]] and the United Nations (UN), led by Syngman Rhee.</li>
<li><strong>United States:</strong> President [[Harry S. Truman]] initially, then Dwight D. Eisenhower. General Douglas MacArthur played a key role until relieved of command.</li>
<li><strong>China:</strong> Mao Zedong, intervened in the war to support North Korea.</li>
<li><strong>United Nations:</strong> Contributed troops, primarily led by the United States, under UN mandate.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">WHAT:</h2>
<p>A conflict that began when North Korea invaded South Korea in an attempt to unify the peninsula under communist rule. The United Nations, primarily led by the United States, intervened to defend South Korea.  China intervened when UN forces pushed too close to the Chinese border. The war ended in a stalemate with an armistice agreement that created the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) roughly along the 38th parallel, the pre-war border.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">IMPACT: Why Significant?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Containment Policy:</strong>  Demonstrated the US commitment to the policy of containment of communism.  The [[Korean War]] became a major testing ground for this policy.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Military Spending:</strong> Led to a significant increase in US military spending and a permanent militarization of foreign policy (NSC-68).</li>
<li><strong>Expansion of US Alliances:</strong> Strengthened US alliances with countries in Asia and the Pacific.</li>
<li><strong>Strained US-China Relations:</strong> Deepened the divide between the [[United States]] and China, setting the stage for decades of [[Cold War]] antagonism.</li>
<li><strong>Executive Power:</strong> Led to an expansion of presidential power, as Truman committed troops without a formal declaration of war by Congress.</li>
<li><strong>Limited War:</strong> The war illustrated the concept of a &ldquo;limited war,&rdquo; where the [[United States]] aimed to achieve specific objectives without escalating to a full-scale conflict with the Soviet Union or China.</li>
<li><strong>Division of Korea:</strong> Solidified the division of the Korean peninsula into two separate states, North Korea and South Korea, which continues to this day.</li>
<li><strong>McCarthyism:</strong> Intensified anti-communist sentiment in the [[United States]] and fueled McCarthyism, as Americans feared communist infiltration.</li>
<li><strong>Integration of Military:</strong> Accelerated the integration of the US military by allowing African Americans into combat positions.</li>
</ul>
