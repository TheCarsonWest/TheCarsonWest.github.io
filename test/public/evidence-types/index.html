<p>This note covers different types of evidence.  See [[Evidence Evaluation]] for considerations on assessing the quality of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>I. Types of Evidence:</strong></p>
<p>A. <strong>Direct Evidence:</strong>  This type of evidence directly proves a fact.  Examples include eyewitness testimony, a confession, or a video recording of a crime.  The probative value is generally high if credible.</p>
<p>B. <strong>Circumstantial Evidence:</strong> This type of evidence indirectly suggests a fact. It requires inference to connect it to a conclusion.  Multiple pieces of circumstantial evidence can be highly persuasive. Examples include:</p>
<pre><code>* **Physical Evidence:** Fingerprints, DNA, weapons, tire tracks, etc.  ([[Forensic Analysis]])
* **Documentary Evidence:** Contracts, emails, letters, financial records, etc. ([[Document Examination]])
* **Testimonial Evidence:** Witness statements that don't directly prove a fact but provide context or supporting information.  Credibility is crucial (see [[Witness Credibility]]).
</code></pre>
<p>C. <strong>Real Evidence:</strong>  Physical objects directly involved in the event in question (e.g., the murder weapon, a stolen item).  This is often considered the most reliable type of evidence, but it must be properly authenticated and handled to maintain its integrity. [[Chain of Custody]]</p>
<p>D. <strong>Demonstrative Evidence:</strong>  Illustrative materials created to help explain other evidence (e.g., maps, diagrams, charts, models, reenactments). Its value depends on the accuracy of its representation of the facts.  ([[Visual Evidence Analysis]])</p>
<p>E. <strong>Hearsay Evidence:</strong> Statements made outside of court that are offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Generally inadmissible in court unless it falls under an exception (e.g., excited utterance, dying declaration).   $ P(H|E) \neq P(E|H) $   This highlights the importance of distinguishing between the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis and the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence (Bayes&rsquo; Theorem). [[Hearsay Exceptions]]</p>
<p><strong>II.  Scientific Evidence:</strong></p>
<p>This requires expertise to interpret and involves a specific scientific method. Its admissibility often depends on meeting standards like the Daubert standard (in the US) which considers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Testing of the theory or technique</li>
<li>Peer review and publication</li>
<li>Error rate</li>
<li>General acceptance in the relevant scientific community</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples include: DNA analysis, ballistic analysis, toxicology reports. [[Scientific Methodology]]</p>
<p><strong>III. Weight and Sufficiency of Evidence:</strong></p>
<p>The weight given to different types of evidence varies depending on factors such as credibility, reliability, and corroboration with other evidence.  Sufficient evidence is enough to convince a judge or jury beyond a reasonable doubt (in a criminal case) or by a preponderance of the evidence (in a civil case).  This is not a simple mathematical calculation but rather a holistic assessment.  $ Weight(E) = f(Reliability(E), Credibility(E), Corroboration(E)) $   ([[Legal Standards of Proof]])</p>
