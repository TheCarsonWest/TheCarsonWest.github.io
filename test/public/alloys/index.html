<p>• <strong>Alloys</strong> are metallic, homogeneous mixtures composed of two or more elements.
• These mixtures include both <strong>pure metals</strong> and <strong>alloys</strong>.
• <strong>Pure metals</strong> serve as the baseline for understanding metal properties (e.g., malleability, conductivity).</p>
<h2 id="types-of-alloys"><strong>Types of Alloys:</strong></h2>
<h3 id="substitutional-alloys"><strong>Substitutional Alloys:</strong></h3>
<p>• In these alloys, some of the atoms of the base metal are replaced by atoms of a different element that have a similar size.
• Example: <strong>Brass</strong> (Copper and Zinc) and <strong>Bronze</strong> (Copper and Tin) are common substitutional alloys.
• These alloys are generally malleable and maintain properties such as lower electrical conductivity than pure metals.
• They have similar densities to the base metal, offering a blend of properties between the elements involved.</p>
<h3 id="interstitial-alloys"><strong>Interstitial Alloys:</strong></h3>
<p>• Occurs when smaller atoms fit into the spaces (interstices) between the larger atoms in a crystal lattice.
• Example: <strong>Steel</strong>, where small carbon atoms fit into the interstices of iron’s crystal lattice.
• These alloys are harder and less malleable than substitutional alloys.
• Due to the restricted movement of atoms, interstitial alloys tend to have <strong>higher melting points</strong>.
• The hardness and strength come from the atoms’ interference with each other, making bending more difficult.</p>
<h3 id="combination-of-substitutional-and-interstitial-alloys"><strong>Combination of Substitutional and Interstitial Alloys:</strong></h3>
<p>• Example: <strong>Stainless Steel</strong>, a hybrid alloy, where <strong>chromium</strong> substitutes some of the <strong>iron</strong> atoms (substitutional), and <strong>carbon</strong> atoms occupy interstitial spaces.
• Stainless steel exhibits both the hardness and toughness of interstitial alloys and the corrosion resistance and sheen from chromium substitution.</p>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>
<p>• <strong>Substitutional Alloys</strong> (e.g., brass and bronze):
- Tend to be <strong>malleable</strong> (easy to shape).
• Lower <strong>electrical conductivity</strong> compared to pure metals.
• <strong>Density</strong> is similar to the pure metal from which they are derived.
• <strong>Interstitial Alloys</strong> (e.g., steel):
• Generally <strong>harder</strong> and <strong>less malleable</strong> due to atoms interfering with each other’s movements.
• Have a <strong>higher melting point</strong> due to restricted atomic movement.
• <strong>Combination Alloys</strong> (e.g., stainless steel):
• Exhibit unique properties like <strong>corrosion resistance</strong>, <strong>shine</strong>, and <strong>hardness</strong>.</p>
<p>These three types of alloys highlight how combining different elements can drastically alter the properties of metals to make them suitable for various industrial and practical applications.</p>
