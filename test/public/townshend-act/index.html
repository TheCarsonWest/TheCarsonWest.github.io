<h2 id="id-townshend-acts">ID: Townshend Acts</h2>
<h2 id="when-june-1767">When: June 1767</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>British Parliament:</strong>  Passed the acts.</li>
<li><strong>American Colonists:</strong> Primarily affected by the acts.</li>
<li><strong>Charles Townshend:</strong>  British Chancellor of the Exchequer who proposed the acts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A series of acts passed by the British Parliament that imposed taxes on goods imported into the American colonies.  These taxes included duties on tea, glass, lead, paint, and paper.  The stated purpose was to raise revenue to pay for the British military presence in North America following the French and Indian War.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Colonial Resistance:</strong> The Acts sparked widespread protests and boycotts in the colonies, escalating tensions between Great Britain and its American colonies.  Groups such as the Sons of Liberty emerged and actively resisted the taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Importation Agreements:</strong> Colonists organized boycotts of British goods, significantly impacting British trade.  This demonstrated colonial unity and power in resistance.</li>
<li><strong>Colonial Propaganda:</strong> The Acts fueled colonial narratives of British tyranny and oppression, contributing to growing calls for independence.</li>
<li><strong>Repeal (Except for Tea):</strong>  The Townshend Acts were largely repealed in 1770 due to economic pressure and colonial resistance, however, the tax on tea was kept to symbolically assert British authority.  The continued tax on tea would ultimately become a major cause of the Boston Tea Party.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Tensions:</strong> The acts represented a significant escalation in the conflict between Britain and the colonies, laying the groundwork for the American Revolution.</li>
