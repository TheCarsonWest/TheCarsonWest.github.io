<h2 id="when-march-11-1941">When: March 11, 1941</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>:</strong> <a href="./../franklin-d.-roosevelt/">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> (President) and the US Congress</li>
<li><strong>Allied Nations (primarily):</strong> <a href="./../great-britain/">Great Britain</a>, Soviet Union, China</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A program enacted by the US Congress that allowed the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> to provide military aid (weapons, food, equipment) to Allied nations during World War II without requiring immediate payment. Essentially, the US would &ldquo;lend&rdquo; or &ldquo;lease&rdquo; supplies to countries whose defense was deemed vital to the security of the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>. It was designed to circumvent the Neutrality Acts.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shift from Neutrality:</strong> Represented a significant departure from the official US policy of neutrality, moving the nation closer to active involvement in WWII.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Support for Allies:</strong> Provided crucial economic and material support to <a href="./../great-britain/">Great Britain</a> (which was nearing bankruptcy), the Soviet Union (after Germany invaded), and other Allied nations, helping them resist Axis aggression.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Arsenal of Democracy&rdquo;:</strong> Allowed the US to become the &ldquo;arsenal of democracy,&rdquo; producing vast amounts of war materials to support the Allied war effort, boosting the American economy and industry.</li>
<li><strong>Undeclared Naval War:</strong> German submarines targeted ships delivering Lend-Lease aid, leading to increasing tensions and undeclared naval warfare between the US and Germany before the attack on Pearl Harbor.</li>
<li><strong>Post-War Debt &amp; Influence:</strong> Created a complex web of debts and obligations after the war, which further solidified the US&rsquo;s position as a global superpower.</li>
<li><strong>Path to US Entry into WWII:</strong> The act signaled a clear US commitment to the Allied cause and paved the way for the nation&rsquo;s full-scale entry into World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor.</li>
