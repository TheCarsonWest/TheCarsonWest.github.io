It leverages the fact that in a mixture, each component will exert its own [[vapor pressure]], and the more volatile component (the one with the lower boiling point) will have a higher [[vapor pressure]].</h1>
<h2 id="basic-principles">Basic Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>[[Vapor Pressure]]:</strong> [[Vapor Pressure]]  The pressure exerted by a vapor in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases (liquid or solid) at a given temperature in a closed system.</li>
<li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> The temperature at which the [[vapor pressure]] of a liquid equals the external pressure surrounding the liquid.</li>
<li><strong>[[partial pressure]]:</strong>  In a mixture of gases, each gas exerts its own [[partial pressure]].  The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of all the gases present.</li>
<li><strong>[[Raoults Law]]:</strong>  [[Raoults Law]] For an ideal solution, the [[partial pressure]] of each component is equal to the product of the pure component&rsquo;s [[vapor pressure]] and its mole fraction in the liquid mixture.  Mathematically:</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-p_a--x_a-p_a-">$$ P_A = x_A P_A^* $$</h3>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ P_A $  is the [[partial pressure]] of component A</li>
<li>$ x_A $  is the mole fraction of component A in the liquid phase</li>
<li>$ P_A^* $  is the [[vapor pressure]] of pure component A</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="simple-distillation">Simple [[Distillation]]</h2>
<p>Simple distillation is effective for separating liquids with significantly different boiling points (generally a difference of at least 25Â°C).  The mixture is heated, and the more volatile component vaporizes first.  The vapor is then cooled and condensed back into a liquid, which is collected separately.</p>
<h2 id="fractional-distillation">Fractional [[Distillation]]</h2>
<p>Fractional distillation is used to separate liquids with closer boiling points.  It employs a fractionating column, which provides a large surface area for multiple condensation and vaporization cycles. As the vapor rises through the column, it repeatedly condenses and re-vaporizes.  With each cycle, the vapor becomes richer in the more volatile component.  This process effectively creates a temperature gradient along the column, allowing for finer separation.

<h2 id="limitations-of-distillation">Limitations of [[Distillation]]</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>[[Azeotropes]]:</strong> [[Azeotropes]] Some mixtures form [[Azeotropes]], which are constant boiling mixtures that cannot be separated by simple distillation.</li>
<li><strong>[[Heat]] sensitive compounds:</strong>  Some compounds decompose at high temperatures, making distillation unsuitable.</li>
<li><strong>Energy intensive:</strong> [[Distillation]] can be an energy-intensive process, especially for large-scale operations.</li>
</ul>

<p>This outline provides a calculus AB level overview of distillation.  The bracketed terms represent topics that could benefit from their own separate explanations, particularly focusing on the underlying principles and calculations involved.</p>
