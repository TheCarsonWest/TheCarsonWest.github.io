<p>Distillation is a separation technique used to purify liquids based on differences in their boiling points.  It leverages the fact that in a mixture, each component will exert its own <a href="./../vapor-pressure/">vapor pressure</a>, and the more volatile component (the one with the lower boiling point) will have a higher <a href="./../vapor-pressure/">vapor pressure</a>.</p>
<h2 id="basic-principles">Basic Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./../vapor-pressure/">Vapor Pressure</a>:</strong> <a href="./../vapor-pressure/">Vapor Pressure</a>  The pressure exerted by a vapor in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases (liquid or solid) at a given temperature in a closed system.</li>
<li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> The temperature at which the <a href="./../vapor-pressure/">vapor pressure</a> of a liquid equals the external pressure surrounding the liquid.</li>
<li><strong><a href="./../partial-pressure/">partial pressure</a>:</strong>  In a mixture of gases, each gas exerts its own <a href="./../partial-pressure/">partial pressure</a>.  The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of all the gases present.</li>
<li><strong><a href="./../raoults-law/">Raoults Law</a>:</strong>  <a href="./../raoults-law/">Raoults Law</a> For an ideal solution, the <a href="./../partial-pressure/">partial pressure</a> of each component is equal to the product of the pure component&rsquo;s <a href="./../vapor-pressure/">vapor pressure</a> and its mole fraction in the liquid mixture.  Mathematically:</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-p_a--x_a-p_a-">$$ P_A = x_A P_A^* $$</h3>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ P_A $  is the <a href="./../partial-pressure/">partial pressure</a> of component A</li>
<li>$ x_A $  is the mole fraction of component A in the liquid phase</li>
<li>$ P_A^* $  is the <a href="./../vapor-pressure/">vapor pressure</a> of pure component A</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="simple-distillation">Simple Distillation</h2>
<p>Simple distillation is effective for separating liquids with significantly different boiling points (generally a difference of at least 25Â°C).  The mixture is heated, and the more volatile component vaporizes first.  The vapor is then cooled and condensed back into a liquid, which is collected separately.</p>
<h2 id="fractional-distillation">Fractional Distillation</h2>
<p>Fractional distillation is used to separate liquids with closer boiling points.  It employs a fractionating column, which provides a large surface area for multiple condensation and vaporization cycles. As the vapor rises through the column, it repeatedly condenses and re-vaporizes.  With each cycle, the vapor becomes richer in the more volatile component.  This process effectively creates a temperature gradient along the column, allowing for finer separation.

<h2 id="limitations-of-distillation">Limitations of Distillation</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./../azeotropes/">Azeotropes</a>:</strong> <a href="./../azeotropes/">Azeotropes</a> Some mixtures form <a href="./../azeotropes/">Azeotropes</a>, which are constant boiling mixtures that cannot be separated by simple distillation.</li>
<li><strong>Heat sensitive compounds:</strong>  Some compounds decompose at high temperatures, making distillation unsuitable.</li>
<li><strong>Energy intensive:</strong> Distillation can be an energy-intensive process, especially for large-scale operations.</li>
</ul>
