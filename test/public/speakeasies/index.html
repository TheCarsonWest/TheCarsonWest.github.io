<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./../operators/">Operators</a>:</strong> Organized crime figures (like Al Capone), entrepreneurs, and ordinary citizens seeking to profit from the illegal liquor trade.</li>
<li><strong>Patrons:</strong> People from all walks of life who wanted to consume alcohol despite the Prohibition laws.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p><a href="./../speakeasies/">Speakeasies</a> were illegal establishments that sold alcoholic beverages during the Prohibition era in the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>. They were often hidden or disguised as legitimate businesses (e.g., restaurants, clubs, stores). Patrons typically needed a password or introduction to gain entry. They offered a variety of alcoholic drinks, often of questionable quality, and frequently featured live music and entertainment.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rise of Organized Crime:</strong> <a href="./../speakeasies/">Speakeasies</a> fueled the growth of organized crime syndicates, who controlled the production, distribution, and sale of illegal liquor. This led to increased violence, corruption, and gang warfare.</li>
<li><strong>Disrespect for the Law:</strong> The widespread flouting of Prohibition laws in speakeasies demonstrated a lack of respect for the government and the law, contributing to a broader sense of lawlessness and social breakdown.</li>
<li><strong>Changing Social Norms:</strong> <a href="./../speakeasies/">Speakeasies</a> contributed to changing social norms, particularly for women, who gained greater access to public drinking spaces and enjoyed a more relaxed atmosphere.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Impact:</strong> While enriching organized crime, speakeasies also drained tax revenue from legitimate businesses and created a black market economy.</li>
<li><strong>Erosion of Support for Prohibition:</strong> The continued existence and popularity of speakeasies demonstrated the failure of Prohibition and contributed to its eventual repeal in 1933 with the 21st Amendment. They highlighted the difficulties in enforcing morality through legislation.</li>
