<h2 id="when-early-to-mid-1940s-specifically-during-world-war-ii">WHEN: Early to Mid 1940s (specifically during World War II)</h2>
<h2 id="who">WHO:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Created By:</strong> [[J]]. Howard Miller (artist) for Westinghouse Electric as a morale-boosting poster.</li>
<li><strong>Represented:</strong> American women entering the workforce in unprecedented numbers during WWII.</li>
<li><strong>Propagandized By:</strong> The U.S. government and media.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">WHAT:</h2>
<ul>
<li>[[Rosie the Riveter]] is a cultural icon representing the millions of American women who worked in factories and shipyards during World War II, replacing men who had gone off to war.</li>
<li>She is often depicted as a strong, confident woman, wearing overalls and a red bandanna, symbolizing patriotism and determination.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;We Can Do It!&rdquo; poster (originally a Westinghouse internal motivation poster) is the image most commonly associated with [[Rosie the Riveter]], though other images and depictions of women in wartime industries also contributed to the icon.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">IMPACT: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shift in Labor Force:</strong> [[Rosie the Riveter]] symbolized the massive influx of women into traditionally male-dominated industries, filling crucial labor shortages and significantly contributing to the American war effort.</li>
<li><strong>Challenged Gender Roles:</strong> Her image challenged traditional gender roles and expectations, promoting the idea of women&rsquo;s capabilities in industrial and technical fields.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Empowerment:</strong> While many women were pressured to leave their jobs after the war as men returned home, [[Rosie the Riveter]] helped pave the way for future generations of women in the workforce and contributed to the burgeoning feminist movement.</li>
<li><strong>Patriotism and National Unity:</strong> Rosie became a symbol of American patriotism and unity, representing the collective effort on the home front to support the war effort.</li>
<li><strong>Post-War Changes:</strong> While many women returned to domestic life after the war, the experience of working in these roles had a lasting impact on their expectations and the broader societal conversation about women&rsquo;s roles.</li>
