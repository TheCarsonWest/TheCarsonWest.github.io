<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>The <a href="./../election-of-1824/">Election of 1824</a> was the first contested presidential election in US history, featuring four prominent candidates from the Democratic-Republican Party. Jackson received the most popular votes and electoral votes but failed to secure a majority. As a result, the election was decided in the House of Representatives, where Henry Clay threw his support behind <a href="./../john-quincy-adams/">John Quincy Adams</a>, who subsequently won the presidency.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rise of Jacksonian Democracy:</strong> Jackson&rsquo;s strong popular support, despite the loss, propelled him to national prominence and laid the groundwork for his successful run in the 1828 election. This also marked the beginning of the &ldquo;Second Party System&rdquo; and the rise of mass democracy in the US.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Corrupt Bargain&rdquo; Controversy:</strong> Jackson&rsquo;s supporters accused Adams and Clay of a &ldquo;corrupt bargain,&rdquo; claiming Clay had swayed the House vote in exchange for a position in Adams&rsquo; administration. This controversy fueled Jackson&rsquo;s future political campaigns and helped define the political landscape for years to come.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in Power Dynamics:</strong> The election highlighted the increasing importance of popular support and the potential for future conflicts between the executive and legislative branches of government. It also set a precedent for contested elections and the potential for power shifts within the party system.</li>
