<p>Medieval Europe often evokes images of disease, famine, and brutal warfare. While these images hold some truth, the era was far more complex than the popular narrative suggests. In this episode of Crash Course European History, John Green delves into the tumultuous 14th and 15th centuries, an era defined by the Black Death, the Hundred Years War, and the erosion of the Church&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a myth: people only drank beer. Beer and ale were nutritious beverages, there were wells with safe and delicious drinking water.</p>
<p>However, the 14th and 15th centuries saw the Black Death, the Great Schism in the Catholic Church, and the Hundred Years War. Also, the Little Ice Age began in the 14th century, leading to cooler temperatures and declining harvests, contributing to stunting and starvation.</p>
<p><strong>The Black Death: A Pandemic of Unimaginable Scale</strong></p>
<p>The Black Death, a devastating pandemic of Bubonic Plague, swept across Europe from Asia. Originating in Tibet, the disease spread through rats, mice, and fleas, hitching rides on human travelers. Thus, the plague was a product of growing human interconnectedness.</p>
<p>Bubonic plague is a horrific disease. The bacterium Yersinia Pestis causes lymph nodes to swell and sometimes burst, leading to high fevers, vomiting blood, and gangrene, which causes extremities and facial features to turn black with necrosis, hence &ldquo;the Black Death.&rdquo; The mortality rate ranged from 50 to 60 percent.</p>
<p>Before the advent of antibiotics, the Black Death was devastating. By the time it reached Constantinople in 1347, around 25 million people had already perished in Asia. Within four years, Europe was decimated, with some areas losing up to 80 percent of their population. Historians estimate that around half of all Europeans died.</p>
<p>Giovanni Boccaccio described the horrors of the time, noting that &ldquo;many died in the open street&hellip; Consecrated churchyards did not suffice for the burial of the vast multitude of bodies, which were heaped by the hundreds in vast trenches, &hellip;like goods in a ship&rsquo;s hold.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The Hundred Years War: A Protracted Struggle for Power</strong></p>
<p>Amidst the devastation of the Black Death, the Hundred Years War further destabilized Europe. Fought between England and France over control of continental territories, the war dragged on for at least 116 years, beginning in 1337.</p>
<p>The war exacerbated existing problems like poor harvests and disease outbreaks while simultaneously contributing to them. It also challenged long-held cultural beliefs, such as the Code of Chivalry, a set of behaviors for knightly opponents.</p>
<p>Initially, chivalry dictated treating fellow knights with respect and trust, holding them for ransom rather than killing them. However, English kings began hiring mercenaries who looted and plundered, undermining these noble ideals. Some mercenaries even continued marauding during truces and peace treaties.</p>
<p>The Hundred Years War also brought about innovation, with non-aristocratic soldiers from England and Wales utilizing the longbow, famed for its combined deadly speed and accuracy. The French innovated with cannons on ships, which the English later adapted for land battles. Gunpowder, a Chinese invention, powered both types of cannons.</p>
<p>The war also witnessed the rise and fall of Joan of Arc, a French peasant girl who led French forces to victory against the English. However, she was captured by the Burgundians, turned over to the English, and burned at the stake in 1431.</p>
<p><strong>The Comforts of Religion Undermined: The Great Schism</strong></p>
<p>European life in the 14th and 15th centuries was undeniably harsh. Violent crime was rampant, the risk of dying in war was high, and malnutrition and child mortality were common.</p>
<p>The Church, meant to provide solace, also faced internal struggles. The question of whether the Church or kings held ultimate authority led to conflict. Pope Boniface VIII asserted the Church&rsquo;s supremacy, but King Philip IV of France challenged his authority.</p>
<p>Philip had the Pope kidnapped, and after his release, he died in 1303. By 1305, Philip orchestrated the election of a French Pope and his installation in Avignon, France, leading to the perception that the papacy was under French control.</p>
<p>In 1377, Pope Gregory XI moved back to Rome, but his death led to the election of two rival Popes, one in Rome and one in Avignon, marking the Great Schism.</p>
<p>This disunity weakened the Church&rsquo;s spiritual authority, compounded by the clergy&rsquo;s inability to provide guidance during the Black Death. People like Catherine of Siena, an ordinary young woman of intense religious faith, emerged as spiritual leaders. She successfully urged Pope Gregory XI to return to Rome.</p>
<p>The Great Schism ended in 1417 with the election of a single Pope, Martin V. However, the damage was done, and the Church&rsquo;s authority was undermined.</p>
<p><strong>The Decline of Christendom and the Rise of New Powers</strong></p>
<p>European Christendom declined in power during this period. In 1453, the Ottomans, a Turkic ethnic group of Muslims, captured Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire. This marked the final fall of the Roman Empire. Islam replaced Christianity as the leading religion in Constantinople, with the Hagia Sophia becoming a mosque.</p>
<p>The use of mercenaries and the impact of the Black Death weakened the feudal system. The labor shortage created by the plague allowed serfs to demand their freedom. Peasants rebelled against the nobility, and urban artisans sought better pay and an end to high taxes.</p>
<p>Even warfare changed, with people fighting for fame and career rather than ethical reasons or God&rsquo;s glory.</p>
<p>Despite the hardships, the era also saw the beginnings of the Renaissance, a rebirth of art, philosophy, and architecture. The Great Renaissance Cathedral of Florence was completed before the end of the Hundred Years War, signaling a new era for Europe.</p>
