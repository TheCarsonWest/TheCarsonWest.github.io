<h2 id="when-1798">When: 1798</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>President <a href="./../john-adams/">John Adams</a></strong> (Federalist) signed the acts into law.</li>
<li><strong>Democratic-Republicans</strong> led by <a href="./../thomas-jefferson/">Thomas Jefferson</a> and <a href="./../james-madison/">James Madison</a> vehemently opposed the acts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A series of four laws passed by the Federalist-controlled Congress:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Naturalization Act:</strong> Increased the residency requirement for U.S. citizenship from 5 to 14 years.</li>
<li><strong>Alien Friends Act:</strong> Allowed the president to deport any non-citizen considered &ldquo;dangerous to the peace and safety of the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Alien Enemies Act:</strong> Allowed the president to deport or imprison any male citizen of a hostile nation during wartime.</li>
<li><strong>Sedition Act:</strong> Made it illegal to publish &ldquo;false, scandalous, and malicious writing&rdquo; against the government or its officials.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact? Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased political tensions:</strong> The acts were widely seen as an attempt by the Federalists to silence their political opponents, the Democratic-Republicans.</li>
<li><strong>Violated the First Amendment:</strong> The Sedition Act, in particular, was a direct attack on freedom of speech and the press.</li>
<li><strong>Contributed to the decline of the Federalist Party:</strong> Public outrage over the acts helped contribute to the Federalist Party&rsquo;s defeat in the <a href="./../election-of-1800/">Election of 1800</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Raised important questions about the balance between national security and individual liberties:</strong>  These questions continue to be debated in the U.S. today.</li>
<li><strong>The <a href="./../kentucky/">Kentucky</a> and <a href="./../virginia/">Virginia</a> Resolutions:</strong>  These resolutions, secretly authored by Jefferson and Madison, argued that states had the right to nullify federal laws they deemed unconstitutional, laying the groundwork for future sectional conflicts.</li>
