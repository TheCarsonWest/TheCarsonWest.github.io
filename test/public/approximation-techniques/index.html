<p>These notes cover approximation techniques useful in solving AP Chemistry problems where exact solutions are impractical or unnecessary.  Often, we make approximations to simplify calculations and focus on the dominant factors affecting a system.</p>
<p><strong>1.  Percent Error:</strong></p>
<p>$ Percent ; Error = \frac{|Experimental ; Value - Theoretical ; Value|}{Theoretical ; Value} \times 100% $</p>
<p>We use percent error to assess the accuracy of our approximations.  A low percent error indicates a good approximation.</p>
<p><strong>2.  Small x Approximation:</strong></p>
<p>This is used extensively in equilibrium problems where the change in concentration ( $ x $ ) is significantly smaller than the initial concentration.  We assume that  $ x $  is negligible compared to the initial concentration.</p>
<p>Example:  Consider the equilibrium reaction  $ HA \rightleftharpoons H^+ + A^- $ . If the initial concentration of  $ HA $  is large and the  $ K_a $  is small, we can often approximate  $ [HA]{eq} \approx [HA]{initial} $ .</p>
<p>$ K_a = \frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]} \approx \frac{x^2}{[HA]_{initial}} $</p>
<p>This simplifies the quadratic equation significantly.  Always check the validity of this assumption by calculating the percent error. If the percent error is below 5%, the approximation is generally considered valid.  [[Small x Approximation Validity]]</p>
<p><strong>3.  Assumptions in [[Equilibrium Calculations]]:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Neglecting the autoionization of water:</strong>  In many cases, the contribution of water to the  $ H^+ $  or  $ OH^- $  concentration can be ignored, particularly when strong acids or bases are involved.  However, this assumption should be checked carefully, especially in calculations involving weak acids or bases.  [[Equilibrium Calculations]] Assumptions]]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assuming complete dissociation:</strong> Strong acids and bases are assumed to dissociate completely in water. [[Strong Acid/Base Dissociation]]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neglecting activity coefficients:</strong>  In ideal solutions, the activity of a species is equal to its concentration.  At low concentrations this is a valid approximation but at higher concentrations we would need to consider activity coefficients. [[Activity Coefficients]]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4.  Significant Figures:</strong></p>
<p>Approximations often affect the number of significant figures that are meaningful.  We should always round our final answers to the appropriate number of significant figures based on the least precise measurement used in the calculation.</p>
<p><strong>5.  Graphical Methods:</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, graphical analysis can be used to make approximations, such as determining the order of a reaction from a plot of concentration versus time.  [[Graphical Analysis of Kinetic Data]]</p>
<p><strong>6.  Iterative Methods:</strong></p>
<p>For more complex problems, iterative methods can be employed to obtain progressively better approximations. This might involve using a first approximation to calculate a second, more accurate approximation, and so on.  This could be useful in solving complex equilibrium problems or non-linear equations where analytical solutions are difficult.  [[Iterative Methods in Chemistry]]</p>
