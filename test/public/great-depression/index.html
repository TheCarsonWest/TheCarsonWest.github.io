<h2 id="when-1929-1939">WHEN: 1929-1939</h2>
<h2 id="who">WHO:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Affected:</strong> The <a href="./../great-depression/">Great Depression</a> affected virtually every American, with disproportionate impact on farmers, industrial workers, and African Americans.</li>
<li><strong>Presidents:</strong> <a href="./../herbert-hoover/">Herbert Hoover</a> (initial response), <a href="./../franklin-d.-roosevelt/">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> (<a href="./../new-deal/">New Deal</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Economists:</strong> Influential economists of the time included John Maynard Keynes, whose theories influenced <a href="./../new-deal/">New Deal</a> policies.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">WHAT:</h2>
<p>A severe worldwide economic downturn that began with the stock market crash on <strong>October 29, 1929</strong> (Black Tuesday). It was characterized by widespread unemployment, bank failures, business closures, deflation, and a decline in international trade. Factors contributing to the depression included overproduction, unequal distribution of wealth, high tariffs, and a lack of regulation in the financial industry.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">IMPACT: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Devastation:</strong> The <a href="./../great-depression/">Great Depression</a> led to widespread poverty and hardship. Unemployment reached 25% and many people lost their homes and farms.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in Government Role:</strong> The crisis prompted a significant expansion of the federal government&rsquo;s role in the economy. The <a href="./../new-deal/">New Deal</a> programs initiated by FDR aimed to provide relief, recovery, and reform.</li>
<li><strong>Social and Psychological Effects:</strong>  The Depression profoundly impacted American society, leading to increased stress, displacement, and altered social structures. It also fostered a sense of disillusionment and distrust in institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Political Realignment:</strong> The Depression led to a major political realignment, with the Democratic Party gaining significant support from labor unions, farmers, and minorities.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Reforms:</strong> The <a href="./../great-depression/">Great Depression</a> led to lasting reforms in the financial system, including the creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</li>
<li><strong>WWII as an Ending Factor:</strong> While <a href="./../new-deal/">New Deal</a> programs helped alleviate some of the suffering, full economic recovery was not achieved until the onset of World War II, when increased demand for war materials stimulated production and employment.</li>
