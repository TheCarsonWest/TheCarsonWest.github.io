This act of political terrorism triggered a chain of events that led to the outbreak of World War I.</h2>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spark of WWI:</strong> The assassination served as the immediate catalyst for the outbreak of World War I. Austria-Hungary, blaming Serbia, issued an ultimatum that Serbia could not reasonably accept, leading to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia.</li>
<li><strong>Alliance System:</strong> The complex system of alliances between European powers (the [[Triple Entente]] – Britain, [[France]], Russia; and the [[Triple Alliance]] – Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy) drew nations into the conflict, escalating a localized crisis into a global war.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in Global Power:</strong> WWI dramatically reshaped the global political landscape, leading to the collapse of empires (Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, Russian, German) and the rise of new nations.  The war also spurred significant social and political changes, including women&rsquo;s suffrage movements and advancements in technology.</li>
<li><strong>US Entry into WWI:</strong> While not directly causing US entry, the war’s escalation and the unrestricted submarine warfare conducted by Germany ultimately led the [[United States]] to declare war on Germany in 1917.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Consequences:</strong> The war&rsquo;s devastating impact on Europe contributed to the rise of fascism and [[Nazism]] and set the stage for World War II.  The [[2425/apush/ids/u6/Treaty of Versailles]], designed to prevent future conflicts, instead sowed the seeds of resentment and instability, ultimately failing to achieve its goals.</li>
