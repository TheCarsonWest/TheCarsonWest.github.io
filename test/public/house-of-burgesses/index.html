<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Members:</strong> Elected representatives from various settlements in [[Virginia]].  Initially dominated by wealthy landowners and planters.  Representation gradually broadened over time, though limitations based on property ownership persisted.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>The [[House of Burgesses]] was the first legislative assembly of elected representatives in the American colonies. It met regularly to debate and pass laws, taxes, and regulations for the Colony of [[Virginia]]. This represented a significant step toward self-government and established a precedent for other colonies.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Self-Government:</strong> The [[House of Burgesses]] provided colonists with a voice in their own governance, even though it was under the ultimate authority of the British Crown.  It fostered a sense of self-reliance and political participation among colonists.</li>
<li><strong>Development of Representative Government:</strong> Its existence and evolution served as a model and provided valuable experience for the later development of representative government in other colonies and ultimately, the [[United States]].</li>
<li><strong>Precedents for later conflicts:</strong>  The gradual increase in the House of Burgess&rsquo; influence, and their increasing confrontation with royal governors, laid the groundwork for future colonial resistance to British policies, culminating in the American Revolution.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Representation:</strong> It&rsquo;s important to acknowledge that the [[House of Burgesses]] did not represent all colonists; only landowning white men could vote or hold office. This unequal representation is key to understanding the limitations of colonial democracy.</li>
