<p><strong>WHEN:</strong> February 1, 1960</p>
<p><strong>WHO:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Started by:</strong> Four African American students: Franklin McCain, Ezell Blair Jr. (later Jibreel Khazan), David Richmond, and Joseph McNeil, all students at <a href="./../north-carolina/">North Carolina</a> A&amp;T, a historically Black college.</li>
<li><strong>Involved:</strong> Other African American students, civil rights activists, local communities, and eventually, the management of Woolworth&rsquo;s stores.</li>
<li><strong>Inspired by:</strong> The broader <a href="./../civil-rights-movement/">Civil Rights Movement</a> and the nonviolent direct action tactics promoted by groups like the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHAT:</strong></p>
<p>A series of nonviolent protests that began when four African American students sat down at a &ldquo;whites-only&rdquo; lunch counter at a Woolworth&rsquo;s store in Greensboro, North Carolina, and requested service. They were refused service but remained seated. The next day, more students joined them, and the sit-ins continued and spread to other cities across the South.</p>
<p><strong>IMPACT: Why Significant?:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sparked a movement:</strong> The Greensboro sit-ins ignited a wave of similar protests and sit-ins across the South, challenging segregation in public accommodations.</li>
<li><strong>Increased national awareness:</strong> The sit-ins brought the issue of racial segregation to national attention and helped galvanize support for the Civil Rights Movement.</li>
<li><strong>Economic pressure:</strong> The sit-ins led to economic pressure on businesses that practiced segregation, as customers (both Black and white) boycotted segregated establishments.</li>
<li><strong>Desegregation of lunch counters:</strong> Many Woolworth&rsquo;s stores and other businesses in the South began to desegregate their lunch counters due to the sit-ins and the resulting economic pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Empowerment of students:</strong> The sit-ins demonstrated the power of student activism and grassroots organizing in the fight for civil rights.</li>
<li><strong>Momentum for the Civil Rights Act:</strong> The Greensboro sit-ins helped build momentum for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.</li>
