<p>When comparing two population proportions, a confidence interval for their difference provides a range of plausible values for  $ (p_1 - p_2) $ . This interval is a powerful tool for making an informed decision or justifying a claim about whether there&rsquo;s a significant difference between the two proportions, or if one proportion is greater/less than the other.</p>
<h2 id="the-purpose-of-justification">The Purpose of Justification</h2>
<p>The goal is to determine if the confidence interval for  $ (p_1 - p_2) $  supports a specific claim about the relationship between  $ p_1 $  and  $ p_2 $ . Common claims include:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ p_1 \neq p_2 $  (there is a difference)</li>
<li>$ p_1 &gt; p_2 $  (or  $ p_1 - p_2 &gt; 0 $ )</li>
<li>$ p_1 &lt; p_2 $  (or  $ p_1 - p_2 &lt; 0 $ )</li>
<li>$ p_1 = p_2 $  (there is no difference)</li>
</ul>
<p>For a deeper understanding of how these intervals are constructed, refer to <a href="./../constructing-a-confidence-interval-for-a-population-proportion/">Constructing a Confidence Interval for a Population Proportion</a> and <a href="./../sampling-distributions-for-differences-in-sample-proportions/">Sampling Distributions for Differences in Sample Proportions</a>.</p>
<h2 id="interpreting-the-confidence-interval">Interpreting the Confidence Interval</h2>
<p>The key to justifying a claim lies in observing where the value 0 falls relative to the confidence interval  $ (L, U) $ , where  $ L $  is the lower bound and  $ U $  is the upper bound.</p>
<h3 id="case-1-the-interval-contains-0">Case 1: The Interval Contains 0</h3>
<p>If the confidence interval  $ (L, U) $  for  $ (p_1 - p_2) $  includes 0:</p>
<ul>
<li>This means that 0 is a plausible value for the true difference between  $ p_1 $  and  $ p_2 $ .</li>
<li>Therefore, we do not have convincing evidence to claim that  $ p_1 $  and  $ p_2 $  are different.</li>
<li>It is plausible that  $ p_1 = p_2 $ .</li>
<li>We cannot conclude that one proportion is definitively greater or less than the other.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A 95% confidence interval for  $ (p_1 - p_2) $  is  $ (-0.05, 0.03) $ . Since this interval contains 0, we cannot conclude there&rsquo;s a significant difference between  $ p_1 $  and  $ p_2 $  at the 95% confidence level.</p>
<h3 id="case-2-the-interval-does-not-contain-0">Case 2: The Interval Does Not Contain 0</h3>
<p>If the confidence interval  $ (L, U) $  for  $ (p_1 - p_2) $  does not include 0, this provides convincing evidence of a difference between  $ p_1 $  and  $ p_2 $ . There are two sub-cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Interval is Entirely Above 0 ( $ L &gt; 0 $ ):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This means all plausible values for  $ (p_1 - p_2) $  are positive.</li>
<li>Therefore, we have convincing evidence that  $ p_1 - p_2 &gt; 0 $ , which implies  $ p_1 &gt; p_2 $ .</li>
<li>We can claim that  $ p_1 $  is significantly greater than  $ p_2 $ .</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A 95% confidence interval for  $ (p_1 - p_2) $  is  $ (0.02, 0.08) $ . Since the entire interval is above 0, we are 95% confident that  $ p_1 $  is between 2% and 8% higher than  $ p_2 $ . We have convincing evidence that  $ p_1 &gt; p_2 $ .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interval is Entirely Below 0 ( $ U &lt; 0 $ ):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This means all plausible values for  $ (p_1 - p_2) $  are negative.</li>
<li>Therefore, we have convincing evidence that  $ p_1 - p_2 &lt; 0 $ , which implies  $ p_1 &lt; p_2 $ .</li>
<li>We can claim that  $ p_1 $  is significantly less than  $ p_2 $ .</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A 95% confidence interval for  $ (p_1 - p_2) $  is  $ (-0.10, -0.03) $ . Since the entire interval is below 0, we are 95% confident that  $ p_1 $  is between 3% and 10% lower than  $ p_2 $ . We have convincing evidence that  $ p_1 &lt; p_2 $ .</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-role-of-confidence-level">The Role of Confidence Level</h2>
<p>The confidence level (e.g., 90%, 95%, 99%) reflects the strength of our conclusion. A 95% confidence interval implies that if we were to repeat the sampling process many times, 95% of the intervals constructed would capture the true difference.</p>
<p>A higher confidence level will result in a wider interval, making it more likely to contain 0, and thus less likely to show a significant difference. Conversely, a lower confidence level will result in a narrower interval, making it more likely to exclude 0.</p>
<h2 id="confidence-intervals-vs-hypothesis-testsconfidence-intervals-vs-hypothesis-tests"><a href="./../confidence-intervals-vs.-hypothesis-tests/">Confidence Intervals vs. Hypothesis Tests</a></h2>
<p>Justifying a claim based on a confidence interval is closely related to performing a <a href="./../setting-up-a-test-for-the-difference-of-two-population-proportions/">Setting Up a Test for the Difference of Two Population Proportions</a>. In fact, a confidence interval can be used to perform a two-sided hypothesis test:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a  $ (1-\alpha) \times 100% $  confidence interval for  $ (p_1 - p_2) $  contains 0, then a two-sided hypothesis test at significance level  $ \alpha $  would fail to reject the null hypothesis  $ H_0: p_1 = p_2 $ .</li>
<li>If the interval does not contain 0, then the two-sided test would reject  $ H_0 $ .</li>
</ul>
<p>Confidence intervals provide more information than a hypothesis test alone because they give a range of plausible values for the true difference, not just a &ldquo;yes/no&rdquo; decision.</p>
<p>The general form of a confidence interval for the difference of two population proportions is:
$$ (\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2) \pm z^* \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}} $$  where  $ \hat{p}_1 $  and  $ \hat{p}_2 $  are the sample proportions,  $ n_1 $  and  $ n_2 $  are the sample sizes, and  $ z^* $  is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the desired confidence level.</p>
