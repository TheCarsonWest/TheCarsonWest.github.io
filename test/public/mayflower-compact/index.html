<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pilgrims (Separatist <a href="./../puritans/">Puritans</a>) aboard the Mayflower</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A social contract signed by 41 male Pilgrims aboard the Mayflower before landing at Plymouth. It established a civil government based on majority rule and committed the signatories to enact just and equal laws for the general good of the colony.  It was not a constitution, but a framework for self-governance.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-Governance:</strong>  Established a precedent for self-government in the American colonies, preceding formal charters from the English crown. This demonstrated the colonists&rsquo; desire for autonomy and their willingness to create their own governing structures.</li>
<li><strong>Social Contract Theory:</strong>  Represents an early example of a social contract, where individuals voluntarily surrender certain rights to form a government for mutual benefit and protection.  This idea would become central to American political thought.</li>
<li><strong>Foundation of Plymouth Colony:</strong> Provided a basis for the legal and social order of the Plymouth Colony, contributing to its relative success in the challenging early years.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Scope:</strong>  It only applied to the Pilgrims who signed it;  it did not establish a system for governing the broader indigenous populations.</li>
<li><strong>Religious Motivation:</strong>  While establishing a civil government, the compact was underpinned by the Pilgrims&rsquo; strong religious beliefs and their desire to create a godly society in the New World.</li>
