<p>William Henry Harrison (1773-1841) was the ninth <a href="./../potus/">POTUS</a>, serving the shortest term in presidential history. His fame primarily rested on his military career, particularly his role in the <a href="./../war-of-1812/">War of 1812</a>.</p>
<h2 id="events-associated-with">Events Associated With</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Battle of Tippecanoe (1811):</strong> This battle, fought against the <a href="./../native-american/">Native American</a> forces of Tecumseh&rsquo;s Confederacy, made Harrison a national hero and earned him the nickname &ldquo;Tippecanoe.&rdquo; It significantly weakened <a href="./../native-american/">Native American</a> resistance in the Northwest Territory.</li>
<li><strong>War of 1812:</strong> Harrison commanded American forces in the Northwest, winning the Battle of the Thames in 1813, which resulted in the death of Tecumseh and the collapse of his confederacy. His military success contributed to the overall American victory in the war.</li>
<li><strong>Presidency (1841):</strong> Harrison&rsquo;s presidency lasted only 31 days. He contracted pneumonia shortly after his inauguration and died soon after.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Brief Presidency:</strong> Harrison&rsquo;s short presidency set a precedent for presidential succession. His death led to <a href="./../john-tyler/">John Tyler</a>, his Vice President, assuming the presidency.
