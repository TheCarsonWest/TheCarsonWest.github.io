<p>When we analyze two categorical variables, our goal often extends beyond just representing their relationship (as discussed in [[Representing Two Categorical Variables]]) to making inferences about whether a relationship exists in the population, or if the distribution of one variable is different across categories of another. This typically involves [[Chi-Square Tests]].</p>
<h2 id="types-of-relationships">Types of Relationships</h2>
<p>There are two primary questions we ask when dealing with two categorical variables in an inferential context:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Association/Independence</strong>: Is there an association between the two variables, or are they independent? This is addressed by a <strong>Chi-Square Test for Independence</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Homogeneity</strong>: Is the distribution of one categorical variable the same across different populations or groups defined by the other categorical variable? This is addressed by a <strong>Chi-Square Test for Homogeneity</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>While these tests are conceptually distinct, their calculation and interpretation are often very similar.</p>
<h2 id="observed-vs-expected-counts">Observed vs. Expected Counts</h2>
<p>The core idea behind inferential tests for two categorical variables is comparing the observed counts in a two-way table to the counts we would expect if there were no association (i.e., if the variables were independent or the distributions were homogeneous).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Observed Counts</strong>: These are the actual frequencies obtained from the sample data, usually displayed in a [[Representing Two Categorical Variables]] (contingency table).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Expected Counts</strong>: These are the counts we would anticipate in each cell of the two-way table if the null hypothesis were true (i.e., if the variables were independent or the distributions were homogeneous).</p>
<p>The formula for the expected count for a cell is:
$$      E = \frac{(\text{row total}) \times (\text{column total})}{\text{grand total}}
$$      Understanding and calculating these is crucial for [[Expected Counts in Two-Way Tables]].</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chi-square-test-statistic">Chi-Square Test Statistic</h2>
<p>To quantify the difference between the observed and expected counts, we use the Chi-Square ( $ \chi^2 $ ) test statistic. This statistic sums up the squared differences between observed and expected counts, weighted by the expected counts, across all cells in the table.</p>
<p>$$  \chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E}
$$<br>
Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ O $  = Observed count for a cell</li>
<li>$ E $  = Expected count for a cell</li>
<li>$ \sum $  denotes summing over all cells in the two-way table.</li>
</ul>
<p>A larger  $ \chi^2 $  value indicates a greater discrepancy between observed and expected counts, suggesting stronger evidence against the null hypothesis of independence or homogeneity.</p>
<h2 id="degrees-of-freedom">Degrees of Freedom</h2>
<p>The degrees of freedom (df) for a Chi-Square test for two categorical variables are calculated based on the dimensions of the two-way table:</p>
<p>$$  df = (\text{number of rows} - 1) \times (\text{number of columns} - 1)
$$<br>
The degrees of freedom, along with the calculated  $ \chi^2 $  statistic, are used to find the p-value.</p>
<h2 id="performing-the-test">Performing the Test</h2>
<p>The process for conducting a Chi-Square test for homogeneity or independence generally follows the standard hypothesis testing framework:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>State Hypotheses</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Null Hypothesis ( $ H_0 $ )</strong>: There is no association between the two categorical variables (independence), or the distribution of one variable is the same across all populations/groups (homogeneity).</li>
<li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis ( $ H_a $ )</strong>: There is an association between the two categorical variables (dependence), or the distribution of one variable is not the same across all populations/groups (heterogeneity).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check Conditions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Random Sample/Assignment</strong>: Data must come from a random sample(s) or a randomized experiment.</li>
<li><strong>Large Sample Size</strong>: All expected counts ( $ E $ ) must be at least 5. (This is a common rule of thumb, sometimes slightly relaxed for a small number of cells).</li>
<li><strong>Independence</strong>: Observations within groups and between groups must be independent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Calculate Test Statistic and p-value</strong>: Compute the  $ \chi^2 $  statistic and its corresponding p-value using the degrees of freedom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make a Decision and Conclude</strong>: Compare the p-value to the significance level ( $ \alpha $ ) and interpret the results in context.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This full procedure is detailed in [[Setting Up a Chi-Square Test for Homogeneity or Independence]] and [[Carrying Out a Chi-Square Test for Homogeneity or Independence]].</p>
<h2 id="choosing-the-right-test">Choosing the Right Test</h2>
<p>The choice between a Chi-Square Test for Independence and a Chi-Square Test for Homogeneity depends on the study design:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Test for Independence</strong>: Used when a single sample is taken, and two categorical variables are measured for each individual (e.g., surveying students about their major and their preferred study method).</li>
<li><strong>Test for Homogeneity</strong>: Used when separate samples are taken from two or more populations/groups, and one categorical variable is measured for each individual in each sample (e.g., taking separate samples of men and women and asking them about their preferred political party).</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the conceptual difference in design, the calculations for the  $ \chi^2 $  statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value are identical for both tests. For more guidance on choosing an appropriate test, refer to [[Selecting an Appropriate Inference Procedure for Categorical]].</p>
