<h1 id="andrew-johnson-a-contentious-presidency">Andrew Johnson: A Contentious Presidency</h1>
<p>Andrew Johnson (1808-1875) served as the 17th <a href="./../potus/">POTUS</a> of the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> from 1865 to 1869, following the <a href="./../the-assassination-of-abraham-lincoln/">The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln</a>. His presidency was largely defined by his clashes with Congress over <a href="./../reconstruction/">Reconstruction</a> policies after the <a href="./../civil-war/">Civil War</a>, ultimately leading to his impeachment.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>Born into poverty in Raleigh, North Carolina.</li>
<li>Self-educated and became a tailor.</li>
<li>Moved to Tennessee and entered politics, serving as a mayor, state legislator, U.S. Congressman, and U.S. Senator.</li>
<li>A Democrat who remained loyal to the Union during the Civil War, he was appointed military governor of Tennessee.</li>
<li>Chosen as <a href="./../abraham-lincoln%7Clincoln's/">Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln&rsquo;s</a> Vice President in 1864 as a gesture of unity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-events-and-policies">Key Events and Policies</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Presidential Reconstruction (1865-1866):</strong> <a href="./../andrew-johnson%7Cjohnson/">Andrew Johnson|Johnson</a> implemented a lenient plan for Reconstruction, which aimed to quickly restore the Southern states to the Union. His plan included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pardons to former Confederates who pledged allegiance to the Union.</li>
<li>Required Southern states to ratify the <a href="./../13th-amendment/">13th amendment</a>, abolishing slavery.</li>
<li>Allowed Southern states to establish new governments with limited federal oversight.</li>
<li>This plan was viewed by many in the north as being too lenient, and many states took advantage of the loose regulation to implement things such as <a href="./../black-codes/">Black Codes</a> that curtailed the freedoms of African-Americans.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vetoes of Congressional Reconstruction Legislation:</strong> <a href="./../andrew-johnson%7Cjohnson/">Andrew Johnson|Johnson</a> repeatedly vetoed legislation passed by the <a href="./../radical-republicans/">Radical Republicans</a> in Congress that aimed to protect the rights of freedmen and punish the South, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./../freedmans-bureau%7Cextension-of-the-freedmen's-bureau/">Freedmans Bureau|Extension of the Freedmen&rsquo;s Bureau</a>: The Freedmen&rsquo;s Bureau was designed to aid former slaves in the South.</li>
<li><a href="./../civil-rights-act-of-1866/">Civil Rights Act of 1866</a>: Granted citizenship to all persons born in the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> (excluding Native Americans) and prohibited discrimination based on race.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clash with Congress:</strong> Johnson&rsquo;s vetoes and his opposition to Congressional Reconstruction policies led to a bitter power struggle with the <a href="./../radical-republicans/">Radical Republicans</a> who controlled Congress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="./../tenure-of-office-act/">Tenure of Office Act</a> (1867):</strong> Congress passed this act to restrict the president&rsquo;s power to remove cabinet members without Senate approval, aiming to protect Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a <a href="./../radical-republicans%7Cradical-republican/">Radical Republicans|Radical Republican</a> and Johnson critic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impeachment (1868):</strong> <a href="./../andrew-johnson%7Cjohnson/">Andrew Johnson|Johnson</a> violated the <a href="./../tenure-of-office-act/">Tenure of Office Act</a> by firing Edwin Stanton. The House of Representatives impeached him for &ldquo;high crimes and misdemeanors.&rdquo; He was tried by the Senate and acquitted by one vote, avoiding removal from office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Purchase of Alaska (1867):</strong> Secretary of State William Seward negotiated the purchase of <a href="./../alaska/">Alaska</a> from Russia for  $ 7.2 million.  Often ridiculed as &ldquo;Seward&rsquo;s Folly,&rdquo; the acquisition later proved to be a valuable resource.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="important-legislation-signed-limited">Important Legislation Signed (Limited)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Little significant legislation was signed due to Johnson&rsquo;s conflicts with Congress. The most notable was the <a href="./../alaska/">Alaska</a> purchase treaty.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="groups-and-affiliations">Groups and Affiliations</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="./../democrats/">Democrats</a>: Johnson was a lifelong Democrat.</li>
<li>National Union Party: A short-lived coalition party during the 1864 election, aimed at uniting Republicans and War Democrats.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-on-the-country">Impact on the Country</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delayed Reconstruction:</strong> His opposition to Congressional Reconstruction prolonged the process of rebuilding the South and integrating freedmen into society.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Racial Tensions:</strong> His lenient policies towards the South and his vetoes of civil rights legislation emboldened white Southerners and contributed to the rise of <a href="./../jim-crow-laws/">Jim Crow Laws</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Weakened Presidency:</strong> The impeachment proceedings weakened the office of the president and established limits on executive power in relation to Congress.</li>
<li><strong>Solidified Republican Control:</strong> Johnson&rsquo;s actions helped to solidify the <a href="./../republicans%7Crepublican/">Republicans|Republican</a> Party&rsquo;s control over Congress and the nation for several years.</li>
