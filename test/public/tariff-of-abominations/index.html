<h1 id="id-tariff-of-abominations--when-1828">ID: [[Tariff of Abominations]] ## When: 1828</h1>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>[[Andrew Jackson]]:</strong> President at the time, though he opposed the tariff.</li>
<li><strong>Henry Clay:</strong> Architect of the tariff and Secretary of State.</li>
<li><strong>John C. Calhoun:</strong> [[South Carolina]] Senator who vehemently opposed the tariff.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>The Tariff of 1828, often referred to as the &ldquo;[[Tariff of Abominations]],&rdquo; was a high protective tariff passed by the US Congress. It was designed to protect Northern industries from British competition, but it heavily burdened Southern economies reliant on exporting agricultural products.  The South saw it as an unfair tax benefiting the North at their expense.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact? Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>[[Nullification]] Crisis:</strong> The tariff sparked a major political crisis. [[South Carolina]], led by Calhoun, threatened to nullify the tariff within its borders, arguing states had the right to void federal Laws they deemed unconstitutional.</li>
<li><strong>Increased  [[sectionalism]] :</strong> The tariff deepened the divide between the North and South, fueling the debate over states&rsquo; rights and the balance of power within the federal system.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthened Jacksonian Democracy:</strong>  The crisis led to increased support for Jackson and his party, who advocated for a strong central government.</li>
<li><strong>Precursor to the [[Civil War]]:</strong> The tariff was a significant early flashpoint in the growing tension between North and South, contributing to the eventual outbreak of the [[Civil War]].</li>
