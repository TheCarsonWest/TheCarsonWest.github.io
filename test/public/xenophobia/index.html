<h2 id="when-1870s-1900s-peak-intensity-varies-by-target-group-but-generally-spans-the-gilded-age">When: 1870s-1900s (Peak intensity varies by target group, but generally spans the Gilded Age)</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Native-born Americans:</strong>  A significant portion of the population felt threatened by waves of immigration.  Specific groups (e.g., the Know-Nothing Party earlier, but their influence waned; later, more nativist groups emerged).</li>
<li><strong>Immigrants:</strong> Primarily from Southern and Eastern Europe (Italians, Poles, Russians, Jews), Asia (Chinese), and Mexico. These groups faced the brunt of xenophobic sentiment.</li>
<li><strong>Politicians:</strong> Some politicians exploited anti-immigrant sentiment for political gain, advocating for restrictive legislation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>Widespread fear and hatred of foreigners, particularly immigrants, fueled by economic anxieties, religious differences, and racial prejudice.  This manifested in various ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anti-immigrant legislation:</strong> Chinese Exclusion Act (1882), restrictive immigration quotas later in the period though not yet fully implemented in this era.</li>
<li><strong>Violence and discrimination:</strong> Riots targeting specific immigrant groups (e.g., anti-Chinese violence in the West), social exclusion, and job discrimination.</li>
<li><strong>Nativist movements:</strong> Organizations advocating for the restriction of immigration and the preservation of American culture as defined by the dominant native-born white population. Propaganda campaigns depicting immigrants negatively.</li>
<li><strong>Scapegoating:</strong> Immigrants were often blamed for social problems like unemployment, poverty, and crime.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shaping of Immigration Policy:</strong>  The period laid the groundwork for increasingly restrictive immigration policies in the 20th century.</li>
<li><strong>Social and Cultural Impact:</strong> Created deep social divisions and fostered discrimination against specific immigrant communities, leaving lasting legacies on American society.</li>
<li><strong>Political Influence:</strong> Xenophobia played a significant role in shaping political discourse and influenced the actions of both voters and elected officials.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Consequences:</strong> While immigrants contributed significantly to the nation&rsquo;s economic growth,  xenophobic policies and actions limited their opportunities and created social unrest.</li>
<li><strong>Rise of nativism:</strong> Fueled the growth of nativist movements and organizations that would continue to influence American politics for decades to come.</li>
