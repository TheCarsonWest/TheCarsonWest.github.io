<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heightened tensions over slavery:</strong> The Wilmot Proviso intensified the debate over the expansion of slavery into new territories, fueling sectionalism and resentment between the North and South.</li>
<li><strong>Contributed to the rise of the Free Soil Party:</strong> The Proviso attracted support from anti-slavery advocates who coalesced into the Free Soil Party, challenging the dominance of the two major parties.</li>
<li><strong>Precursor to the Compromise of 1850:</strong> The controversy surrounding the Proviso helped set the stage for a series of compromises aimed at resolving the slavery issue, culminating in the Compromise of 1850.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthened sectionalism:</strong> By focusing attention on the issue of slavery expansion, the Wilmot Proviso further solidified sectional identities and intensified political divisions between the North and South.</li>
<li><strong>Symbolic of the growing divide:</strong>  The Proviso became a symbol of the irreconcilable differences between North and South, ultimately contributing to the outbreak of the Civil War.</li>
