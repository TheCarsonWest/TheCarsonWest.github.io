<p>Study Guide Rubric: Each of your study guides should be focused on one major concept but may include connections or comparisons to other topics in the unit (or from previous units). Each study guide should include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A title that identifies the main concept or goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Major equations with variables identified and 1-2 example problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organizational tools such as a mind-map, graphic organizer(s), bullet point summaries, lists, or a labeled and captioned diagram that require you to go back to the material and arrange/use the information in a new way. Use your study materials to make the study guide, but don’t just repeat or rewrite the notes or activities! You want to deepen your understanding of the material and make sure it is available in your brain for the test!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Predicted test questions about the topic, including multiple choice and short answer, with your answer and explanation. Don’t forget to think about the most likely “distractors”!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each study guide should be at least 1 full page to ensure necessary depth for the topic.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Required Course Content
LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
6.6.A
Calculate the heat q
absorbed or released
by a system undergoing
a chemical reaction in
relationship to the amount
of the reacting substance in
moles and the molar enthalpy
of reaction.
6.6.A.1
The enthalpy change of a reaction gives the
amount of heat energy released (for negative
values) or absorbed (for positive values) by a
chemical reaction at constant pressure.
6.6.A.2
When the products of a reaction are at a
differenttemperaturethantheirsurroundings,
they exchange energy with the surroundings
to reach thermal equilibrium. Thermal energy
is transferred to the surroundings as the
reactants convert to products in an exothermic
reaction. Thermal energy is transferred from
the surroundings as the reactants convert to
products in an endothermic reaction.
6.6.A.3
The chemical potential energy of the products
ofareactionisdifferentfromthatofthe
reactants because of the breaking and forming
ofbonds.Theenergydifferenceresultsina
change in the kinetic energy of the particles,
which manifests as a temperature change</p>

<p><strong>1. Introduction:</strong> This study guide focuses on understanding enthalpy of reaction (ΔH), a thermodynamic property that quantifies the heat absorbed or released during a chemical reaction at constant pressure.  We&rsquo;ll explore how to calculate this heat, its relationship to bond energies, and how it relates to exothermic and endothermic processes.</p>
<p><strong>2. Major Equations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>q = nΔH</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>q = heat absorbed or released (Joules or kJ)</li>
<li>n = moles of reactant or product</li>
<li>ΔH = molar enthalpy of reaction (<a href="./../j/">J</a>/mol or kJ/mol)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong>  The molar enthalpy of combustion of methane (CH₄) is -890 kJ/mol.  Calculate the heat released when 2.5 moles of methane are burned.</p>
<ul>
<li>q = (2.5 mol)(-890 kJ/mol) = -2225 kJ (<a href="./../heat/">Heat</a> is released, indicated by the negative sign)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong>  The enthalpy of formation of water is -285.8 kJ/mol. How much heat is released when 10g of water is formed?</p>
<ul>
<li>Moles of water = (10g)/(18.02 g/mol) = 0.555 mol</li>
<li>q = (0.555 mol)(-285.8 kJ/mol) = -158.7 kJ</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</code></pre><p><strong>4. Predicted Test Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Multiple Choice:</strong> Which of the following statements is TRUE about an exothermic reaction?</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) ΔH is positive.</li>
<li>(b) <a href="./../heat/">Heat</a> is absorbed from the surroundings.</li>
<li>(c) The products have higher energy than the reactants.</li>
<li><strong>(d) The reaction releases heat to the surroundings.</strong></li>
<li>Explanation: <a href="./../exothermic/">Exothermic</a> reactions release heat, resulting in a negative ΔH value and a temperature increase in the surroundings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Short Answer:</strong> Explain the relationship between bond energies and enthalpy of reaction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Answer: <a href="./../enthalpy/">Enthalpy</a> of reaction is related to the difference in bond energies between reactants and products.  Breaking bonds requires energy (endothermic), while forming bonds releases energy (exothermic).  A reaction is exothermic if the energy released from forming new bonds is greater than the energy required to break the initial bonds. Conversely, a reaction is endothermic if more energy is required to break bonds than is released when forming new bonds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multiple Choice:</strong>  If the enthalpy change for a reaction is -120 kJ, which of the following is true?</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) The reaction is endothermic and absorbs 120 kJ of heat.</li>
<li><strong>(b) The reaction is exothermic and releases 120 kJ of heat.</strong></li>
<li>(c) The reaction is endothermic and releases 120 kJ of heat.</li>
<li>(d) The reaction is exothermic and absorbs 120 kJ of heat.</li>
<li>Explanation: A negative enthalpy change signifies an exothermic reaction, meaning heat is released.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Short Answer:</strong>  A student mixes two solutions and observes that the beaker gets cold. Is the reaction exothermic or endothermic? Explain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Answer: The reaction is endothermic.  A cold beaker indicates that the reaction is absorbing heat from the surroundings (the beaker and the solution within it), which is characteristic of an endothermic process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5.  Connecting Concepts:</strong>  <a href="./../enthalpy/">Enthalpy</a> changes are related to other thermodynamic quantities like entropy and Gibbs free energy, which help determine spontaneity.  Furthermore, concepts of limiting reactants from Unit X can be applied to enthalpy calculations, ensuring you use the moles of the limiting reactant to determine the total heat released or absorbed.  Also, remember that enthalpy is a state function (Unit Y), meaning its value depends only on the initial and final states, not the pathway taken.</p>
