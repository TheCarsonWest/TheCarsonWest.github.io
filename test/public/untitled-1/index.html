<p>How It Feels to Be Colored Me</p>
<p>Zora Neale Hurston</p>
<p>Zora Neale Hurston (1891-1960) came to prominence in the 1920s during the Harlem Renaissance, a period of enormous creativity of African American artists, writers, and musicians. A novelist, folklorist, and anthropologist, she first gained attention with her short stories, including &ldquo;Sweat&rdquo; and &ldquo;Spunk.&rdquo; She is best known for her novel Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937), set in Eatonville, Florida, where Hurston grew up; the town was the first incorporated African American community in the United States. She attended Howard University and won a scholarship to Barnard College in New York City, living in Harlem throughout the 1920s. Toward the end of her life, Hurston remained out of the public eye; she was buried in an unmarked grave in Florida.</p>
<p>KEY CONTEXT Hurston is a major figure of the Harlem Renaissance, an artistic movement spanning the 1920s and 1930s that celebrated Black life and culture. Most of her writing takes place in the American South, where Jim Crow laws enforced racial segregation from the 1870s through the 1960s. &ldquo;How It Feels to Be Colored Me&rdquo; was first published in The World Tomorrow, a progressive political magazine that was an encouraging home for Harlem Renaissance writers, in May 1928.</p>
<h1 id="main-passage">Main passage</h1>
<p>I am colored but I offer nothing in the way of extenuating circumstances except the fact that I am the only Negro in the United States whose grandfather on the mother&rsquo;s side was not an Indian chief.</p>
<p>I remember the very day that I became col-ored. Up to my thirteenth year I lived in the little Negro town of Eatonville, Florida. It is exclusively a colored town. The only white people I knew passed through the town going to or coming from Orlando. The native whites rode dusty horses, the Northern tourists chugged down the sandy village road in automobiles. The town knew the Southerners and never stopped cane chewing when they passed. But the Northerners were something else again. They were peered at cautiously from behind curtains by the timid.</p>
<p>The more venturesome would come out on the porch to watch them go past and got just as much pleasure out of the tourists as the tourists got out of the village.</p>
<p>The front porch might seem a daring place for the rest of the town, but it was a gallery seat for me. My favorite place was atop the gate-post. Proscenium box for a born first-nighter.</p>
<p>Not only did I enjoy the show, but I didn&rsquo;t mind the actors knowing that I liked it. I usually spoke to them in passing. I&rsquo;d wave at them and when they returned my salute, I would say something like this: &ldquo;Howdy-do-well-I-thank-you-where-you-goin&rsquo;?&rdquo; Usually automobile or the horse paused at this, and after a queer exchange of compliments, I would probably &ldquo;go a piece of the way&rdquo; with them, as we say in farthest Florida. If one of my family happened to come to the front in time to see me, of course negotiations would be rudely broken off. But even so, it is clear that I was the first</p>
<p>&ldquo;welcome-to-our-state&rdquo; Floridian, and I hope the Miami Chamber of Commerce will please take notice.During this period, white people differed from colored to me only in that they rode through town and never lived there. They liked to hear me &ldquo;speak pieces&rdquo; and sing and wanted to see me dance the parse-me-la, and gave me generously of their small silver for doing these things, which seemed strange to me for I wanted to do them so much that I needed bribing to stop. Only they didn&rsquo;t know it. The colored people gave no dimes. They deplored any joyful tendencies in me, but I was their Zora nevertheless.
I belonged to them, to the nearby hotels, to the county — everybody&rsquo;s Zora.
But changes came in the family when I was thirteen, and I was sent to school in Jacksonville.
I left Eatonville, the town of the oleanders, as Zora. When I disembarked from the river-boat at Jacksonville, she was no more. It seemed that I had suffered a sea change. I was not Zora of Orange County any more, I was now a little colored girl. I found it out in certain ways. In my heart as well as in the mirror, I became a fast brown — warranted not to rub nor run.
But I am not tragically colored. There is no great sorrow dammed up in my soul, nor lurking behind my eyes. I do not mind at all.
I do not belong to the sobbing school of Negrohood who hold that nature somehow has given them a lowdown dirty deal and whose feelings are all hurt about it. Even in the helter-skelter skirmish that is my life, I have seen that the world is to the strong regardless of a little pigmentation more or less. No, I do not weep at the world — I am too busy sharpening my oyster knife.
Someone is always at my elbow reminding me that I am the granddaughter of slaves. It fails to register depression with me. Slavery is sixty years in the past. The operation was successful and the patient is doing well, thank you. The terrible struggle that made me an American out of a potential slave said &ldquo;On the line!&rdquo; The Reconstruction&rsquo; said &ldquo;Get set!&rdquo;; and the generation before said &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; I am off to a flying start and I must not halt in the stretch to look behind and weep. Slavery is the price I paid for civilization, and the choice was not with me. It is a bully adventure and worth all that I have paid through my ancestors for it. No one on earth ever had a greater chance for glory. The world to be won and nothing to be lost. It is thrilling to think — to know that for any act of mine, I shall get twice as much praise or twice as much blame. It is quite
exciting to hold the center of the national stage, with the spectators not knowing whether to laugh or to weep.
The position of my white neighbor is much more difficult. No brown specter pulls up a chair beside me when I sit down to eat. No dark ghost thrusts its leg against mine in bed.
The game of keeping what one has is never so exciting as the game of getting
I do not always feel colored. Even now I often achieve the unconscious Zora of Eatonville before the Hegira?
I feel most colored when I am thrown against a sharp white background.
For instance at Barnard. &ldquo;Beside 10
the waters of the Hudson&rdquo; I feel my race. Among the thousand white persons, I am a dark rock surged upon, and overswept, but through it all, I remain myself. When covered by the waters, I am; and the ebb but reveals me again.
Sometimes it is the other way around. A white person is set down in our midst, but the contrast is just as sharp for me. For instance, when I sit in the drafty basement that is The New World Cabaret with a white person, my color comes. We enter chatting about any little nothing that we have in common and are seated by the jazz waiters.
In the abrupt way that jazz orchestras have, this one plunges into a number. It loses no time in circumlocutions, but gets right down to business. It constricts the thorax and splits
the heart with its tempo and narcotic harmo-nies. This orchestra grows rambunctious, rears on its hind legs and attacks the tonal veil with primitive fury, rending it, clawing it until it breaks through to the jungle beyond.
I follow those heathen — follow them exult-ingly. I dance wildly inside myself; I yell
within, I whoop; I shake my assegai above my head, I hurl it true to the mark yeeeeooww! I am in the jungle and living in the jungle way.
My face is painted red and yellow and my body is painted blue. My pulse is throbbing like a war drum. I want to slaughter something — give pain, give death to what, I do not know. But the piece ends. The men of the orchestra wipe their lips and rest their fingers.
I creep back slowly to the veneer we call civilization with the last tone and find the white friend sitting motionless in his seat, smoking calmly.
&ldquo;Good music they have here,&rdquo; he remarks, drumming the table with his fingertips.
Music. The great blobs of purple and red emotion have not touched him. He has only heard what I felt. He is far away and I see him but dimly across the ocean and the continent that have fallen between us. He is so pale with his whiteness then and I am so colored.
At certain times I have no race, I am me. When I set my hat at a certain angle and saunter down Seventh Avenue, Harlem City, feeling as snooty as the lions in front of the Forty-Second Street Library, for instance. So far as my feelings are concerned, Peggy Hopkins Joyce* on the Boule Mich&rsquo; with her gorgeous raiment, stately carriage, knees knocking together in a most aristocratic manner, has nothing on me.
The cosmic Zora emerges. I belong to no race nor time. I am the eternal feminine with its string of beads.
Thave no separate feeling about being an American citizen and colored. I am merely a fragment of the Great Soul that surges within the boundaries. My country, right or wrong.
Sometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company? It&rsquo;s beyond me.
But in the main, I feel like a brown bag of miscellany propped against a wall. Against a wall in company with other bags, white, red, and yellow. Pour out the contents, and there is discovered a jumble of small things priceless and worthless. A first-water diamond, an empty spool, bits of broken glass, lengths of string, a key to a door long since crumbled away, a rusty knife-blade, old shoes saved for a road that never was and never will be, a nail bent under the weight of things too heavy for any nail, a dried flower or two still a little fra-grant. In your hand is the brown bag. On the ground before you is the jumble it held - so much like the jumble in the bags, could they be emptied, that all might be dumped in a single heap and the bags refilled without altering the content of any greatly. A bit of colored glass more or less would not matter. Perhaps that is how the Great Stuffer of Bags filled them in the first place — who</p>

<p><strong>Analyzing Language, Style, and Structure</strong></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Hurston writes, &ldquo;I creep back slowly to the veneer we call civilization (par. 11). What does the word veneer suggest about her attitude toward civilization? What has she discovered beneath the veneer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the function of the first paragraph of the essay in setting the tone of the essay? What is its effect on you, the reader?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the tone of the essay shift from paragraph 16 to paragraph 17?</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Composition</strong></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Hurston writes that the &ldquo;position of [her]] white neighbor is much more difficult&rdquo; (par. 8) because Hurston believes she, as a Black woman, has nothing to lose. Later in the paragraph, she explains her philosophy further: &ldquo;The game of keeping what one has is never so exciting at the game of getting.&rdquo; Develop and organize your thoughts on this philosophy. Generally speaking, is getting and achieving mor eexciting than keeping and maintaining? Explain your position in a short essay,</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Understanding and Interpreting the Rhetorical Situation</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Fast brown - warranted not to rub nor run&rdquo; is a reference to the colorfastness of dyes, implying that her Blackness became a permanent, indelible part of her identity in Jacksonville. This starkly contrasts with her experience in Eatonville, where her race wasn&rsquo;t a defining characteristic. The &ldquo;sea change&rdquo; represents her transition from a world where her individuality was paramount to one where her race became her primary identifier in the eyes of others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hurston embraces her racial identity and cultural background with a sense of pride and resilience. In paragraphs 6-8, she rejects the &ldquo;sobbing school of Negrohood,&rdquo; refusing to be defined by the injustices of the past. She emphasizes her strength, ambition, and the unique opportunities her position affords her. Her argument is convincing because it&rsquo;s rooted in personal experience and delivered with unwavering confidence. She focuses on the future and the &ldquo;thrilling&rdquo; possibilities it holds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In paragraph 14, Hurston feels she has &ldquo;no race&rdquo; when her individual identity transcends racial categories.  &ldquo;The cosmic Zora&rdquo; represents her truest self, unbound by societal constructs and connected to a universal human spirit. This occurs when she&rsquo;s fully immersed in her own self-expression, such as strutting down Seventh Avenue or experiencing the transcendent power of music.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hurston&rsquo;s audience is likely a broad, intellectually curious readership, including both white and Black Americans. Her direct address, use of humor, and engagement with complex themes suggest she&rsquo;s aiming for a thoughtful audience willing to consider her perspective. The publication in The World Tomorrow, a progressive magazine, further supports this.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Analyzing Language, Style, and Structure</strong></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Veneer&rdquo; suggests that civilization is a superficial layer masking something more primal and authentic.  Beneath the veneer, Hurston discovers the raw, emotional power of the &ldquo;jungle&rdquo; evoked by the jazz music, a connection to her heritage and a deeper sense of self.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first paragraph establishes a humorous, self-aware tone. Hurston&rsquo;s ironic comment about her grandfather not being an Indian chief immediately challenges stereotypical representations of Black identity, signaling to the reader that this essay will be unconventional and insightful.  It piques the reader&rsquo;s curiosity and invites them to engage with her unique perspective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tone shifts from confident and assertive in paragraph 16, where she discusses her individuality and lack of anger towards discrimination, to a more reflective and philosophical tone in paragraph 17.  The metaphor of the &ldquo;brown bag of miscellany&rdquo; introduces a sense of universality, suggesting that all individuals, regardless of race, are complex mixtures of strengths and weaknesses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Composition</strong></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Hurston&rsquo;s philosophy that &ldquo;getting&rdquo; is more exciting than &ldquo;keeping&rdquo; resonates with the human drive for growth and achievement.  While security and stability are important, the pursuit of new experiences, knowledge, and goals often provides a greater sense of purpose and fulfillment.  The thrill of the chase, the overcoming of obstacles, and the satisfaction of reaching a desired outcome can be profoundly motivating.  However, this doesn&rsquo;t negate the value of maintaining what one has achieved.  The challenge lies in finding a balance between the pursuit of new horizons and the preservation of what is valuable.  Sometimes, the greatest &ldquo;getting&rdquo; comes from the careful tending and growth of what we already possess, nurturing it to its full potential.  Ultimately, the most fulfilling life may involve a dynamic interplay between striving for more and cherishing what we have.  The &ldquo;getting&rdquo; can fuel our passion, while the &ldquo;keeping&rdquo; can provide a foundation of stability and gratitude.</li>
