<p><strong>Goal:</strong> To deeply understand a text by carefully analyzing its meaning and structure.</p>
<p><strong>Key Strategies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Annotate:</strong>  Actively engage with the text.  Mark up the text itself (physical copy) or a digital version.  Use symbols, highlighting, and notes to identify key ideas,  unclear sections, and interesting word choices. [[Annotation Techniques]]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify the Main Idea:</strong> What is the central argument or point of the text?  What is the author trying to convey? [[Identifying Main Ideas]]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analyze Structure:</strong> How is the text organized?  Are there distinct sections or paragraphs? How do these sections relate to each other? Consider the use of headings, subheadings, and transitions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Examine [[Diction and Tone]]:</strong> Pay close attention to the author&rsquo;s word choice.  What kind of language is used (formal, informal, technical)?  What is the overall tone (serious, humorous, sarcastic)?  How does diction contribute to the meaning and effect of the text? [[Diction and Tone Analysis]]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contextualize:</strong> Understand the historical, social, and cultural context in which the text was written. This includes considering the author&rsquo;s background and intended audience. [[Contextual Analysis]]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify Figurative [[Language]]:</strong> Look for metaphors, similes, personification, etc.  What effect do these literary devices have on the meaning and impact of the text?  $ metaphor = \frac{A}{B} $  where A is the subject and B is the object of comparison [[Figurative Language]]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analyze Argumentation:</strong> If the text presents an argument, analyze the evidence and reasoning used to support it. Is the argument convincing? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the argument? [[Argument Analysis]]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider Multiple Interpretations:</strong>  Recognize that texts can have multiple valid interpretations.  Be open to different perspectives and support your interpretations with evidence from the text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Summarize and Synthesize:</strong>  After completing your close reading, summarize the main points of the text and synthesize your observations into a cohesive understanding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Useful Questions to Ask:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What are the key words and phrases in the text?</li>
<li>What is the author&rsquo;s purpose?</li>
<li>What are the main ideas?</li>
<li>How does the text support its main ideas?</li>
<li>What are the author&rsquo;s assumptions?</li>
<li>What are the implications of the text?</li>
<li>How does the text relate to other texts or contexts?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re analyzing a poem.  We would look at the rhyme scheme, meter, imagery, and symbolism, in addition to the other strategies listed above.  The poem&rsquo;s structure might reveal a specific pattern, like an ABAB rhyme scheme or iambic pentameter. Analyzing the imagery could reveal recurring themes or symbolism.</p>
