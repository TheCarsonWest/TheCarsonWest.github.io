<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dates:</strong> Born March 29, 1790, Charles City County, Virginia; Died January 18, 1862, Richmond, Virginia.</li>
<li><strong>Political Party:</strong> Initially a Democrat, then a Whig (though he held states&rsquo; rights views that often clashed with Whig policies), ultimately unaffiliated during his presidency, and later supported the Confederacy.</li>
<li><strong>Vice President:</strong> He didn&rsquo;t have a Vice President for most of his term due to succession.</li>
<li><strong>Term:</strong> 1841-1845 (became President upon the death of William Henry Harrison)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ascension-to-the-presidency-and-initial-conflict">Ascension to the Presidency and Initial Conflict</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;His Accidency&rdquo;:</strong> Tyler was the first Vice President to assume the presidency upon the death of the incumbent (William Henry Harrison). This event raised questions about the constitutional legitimacy of a Vice President fully assuming presidential powers. The Constitution was vague on the matter, stating that the &ldquo;powers and duties&rdquo; of the president would devolve on the Vice President. Tyler interpreted this to mean he was the President, not merely an acting president.</li>
<li><strong>Break with the Whig Party:</strong> Tyler clashed sharply with the Whig Party, particularly with Henry Clay, who expected to control Tyler. Tyler vetoed several key Whig initiatives, including bills to re-establish a national bank. This led to his expulsion from the Whig party and the resignation of his entire cabinet (except for Secretary of State Daniel Webster).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-events-and-policies">Key Events and Policies</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Webster-Ashburton Treaty (1842):</strong> This treaty with Great Britain resolved several border disputes, including the Maine-New Brunswick border and issues related to the Great Lakes. It helped to ease tensions and improve Anglo-American relations. Webster-Ashburton Treaty</li>
<li><strong>Annexation of Texas</strong>: Tyler was a strong proponent of annexing Texas. However, he faced significant opposition in Congress due to concerns about slavery and the potential for war with Mexico.  He ultimately secured passage of a joint resolution in Congress, which required only a simple majority in both houses, rather than a treaty requiring a two-thirds vote in the Senate. The annexation was completed just before he left office. Texas Annexation</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Policy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tyler opposed the re-establishment of a national bank, vetoing two Whig bills aimed at doing so.</li>
<li>He signed the Distribution Act, which distributed surplus federal funds to the states.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Diplomacy:</strong> Tyler sought to expand American influence in the Pacific, sending Caleb Cushing to China to negotiate the Treaty of Wanghia in 1844, granting the United States trade rights similar to those enjoyed by Great Britain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="important-legislation-signed">Important Legislation Signed</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preemption Act of 1841:</strong> Allowed settlers to purchase public land at a low price before it was offered for sale to others.</li>
<li><strong>Naval Appropriations Bill (1842):</strong> Contributed to the expansion of the United States Navy.</li>
<li><strong>Webster-Ashburton Treaty (1842):</strong> Resolved border disputes with Great Britain</li>

<ul>
<li>Democrat (Early Career)</li>
<li>Whig (Briefly)</li>
<li>States&rsquo; Rights Advocates</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-on-the-country">Impact on the Country</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Presidential Succession:</strong> Tyler&rsquo;s presidency solidified the precedent that the Vice President becomes the full President upon the death of the President.  This resolved a constitutional ambiguity.</li>
<li><strong>Expansion:</strong> The annexation of Texas added a vast territory to the United States, but also exacerbated sectional tensions over slavery and led to the Mexican-American War.</li>
<li><strong>State&rsquo;s Rights:</strong> Tyler&rsquo;s presidency demonstrated the continued strength of states&rsquo; rights ideology, particularly in the South.</li>
<li><strong>Political Realignment:</strong> Tyler&rsquo;s break with the Whigs contributed to the fluidity of the political landscape in the 1840s and the eventual demise of the Whig Party.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy of Secession:</strong> Tyler ultimately sided with the Confederacy during the Civil War, even serving in the Confederate Congress. This tarnished his legacy and highlighted the deep sectional divisions that plagued the nation.</li>
