<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dates:</strong> Born March 29, 1790, Charles City County, <a href="./../virginia/">Virginia</a>; Died January 18, 1862, Richmond, Virginia.</li>
<li><strong>Political Party:</strong> Initially a <a href="./../democrat/">Democrat</a>, then a <a href="./../whig/">Whig</a> (though he held states&rsquo; rights views that often clashed with Whig policies), ultimately unaffiliated during his presidency, and later supported the <a href="./../confederacy/">Confederacy</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Vice President:</strong> He didn&rsquo;t have a Vice President for most of his term due to succession.</li>
<li><strong>Term:</strong> 1841-1845 (became President upon the death of William Henry Harrison)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ascension-to-the-presidency-and-initial-conflict">Ascension to the Presidency and Initial Conflict</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;His Accidency&rdquo;:</strong> Tyler was the first Vice President to assume the presidency upon the death of the incumbent (<a href="./../william-henry-harrison/">William Henry Harrison</a>). This event raised questions about the constitutional legitimacy of a Vice President fully assuming presidential powers. The Constitution was vague on the matter, stating that the &ldquo;powers and duties&rdquo; of the president would devolve on the Vice President. Tyler interpreted this to mean he was the President, not merely an acting president.</li>
<li><strong>Break with the Whig Party:</strong> Tyler clashed sharply with the Whig Party, particularly with <a href="./../henry-clay/">Henry Clay</a>, who expected to control Tyler. Tyler vetoed several key Whig initiatives, including bills to re-establish a national bank. This led to his expulsion from the Whig party and the resignation of his entire cabinet (except for Secretary of State <a href="./../daniel-webster/">Daniel Webster</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-events-and-policies">Key Events and Policies</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Webster-Ashburton Treaty (1842):</strong> This treaty with <a href="./../great-britain/">Great Britain</a> resolved several border disputes, including the Maine-New Brunswick border and issues related to the <a href="./../great-lakes/">Great Lakes</a>. It helped to ease tensions and improve Anglo-American relations. <a href="./../webster-ashburton-treaty/">Webster-Ashburton Treaty</a></li>
<li><strong>Annexation of <a href="./../texas/">Texas</a></strong>: Tyler was a strong proponent of annexing <a href="./../texas/">Texas</a>. However, he faced significant opposition in Congress due to concerns about slavery and the potential for war with <a href="./../mexico/">Mexico</a>.  He ultimately secured passage of a joint resolution in Congress, which required only a simple majority in both houses, rather than a treaty requiring a two-thirds vote in the Senate. The annexation was completed just before he left office. <a href="./../texas-annexation/">Texas Annexation</a></li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Policy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tyler opposed the re-establishment of a national bank, vetoing two Whig bills aimed at doing so.</li>
<li>He signed the Distribution Act, which distributed surplus federal funds to the states.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Diplomacy:</strong> Tyler sought to expand American influence in the Pacific, sending Caleb Cushing to <a href="./../china/">China</a> to negotiate the Treaty of Wanghia in 1844, granting the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> trade rights similar to those enjoyed by <a href="./../great-britain/">Great Britain</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="important-legislation-signed">Important Legislation Signed</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preemption Act of 1841:</strong> Allowed settlers to purchase public land at a low price before it was offered for sale to others.</li>
<li><strong>Naval Appropriations Bill (1842):</strong> Contributed to the expansion of the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> Navy.</li>
<li><strong>Webster-Ashburton Treaty (1842):</strong> Resolved border disputes with <a href="./../great-britain/">Great Britain</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="groups-tyler-was-a-part-of">Groups Tyler was a Part Of</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="./../democrat/">Democrat</a> (Early Career)</li>
<li><a href="./../whig/">Whig</a> (Briefly)</li>
<li>States&rsquo; Rights Advocates</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-on-the-country">Impact on the Country</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Presidential Succession:</strong> Tyler&rsquo;s presidency solidified the precedent that the Vice President becomes the full President upon the death of the President.  This resolved a constitutional ambiguity.</li>
<li><strong>Expansion:</strong> The annexation of <a href="./../texas/">Texas</a> added a vast territory to the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>, but also exacerbated sectional tensions over slavery and led to the Mexican-American War.</li>
<li><strong>State&rsquo;s Rights:</strong> Tyler&rsquo;s presidency demonstrated the continued strength of states&rsquo; rights ideology, particularly in the South.</li>
<li><strong>Political Realignment:</strong> Tyler&rsquo;s break with the Whigs contributed to the fluidity of the political landscape in the 1840s and the eventual demise of the Whig Party.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy of Secession:</strong> Tyler ultimately sided with the <a href="./../confederacy/">Confederacy</a> during the <a href="./../civil-war/">Civil War</a>, even serving in the Confederate Congress. This tarnished his legacy and highlighted the deep sectional divisions that plagued the nation.</li>
