<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Continuity is a fundamental concept in calculus that describes the &ldquo;smoothness&rdquo; of a function.  A continuous function is one that can be drawn without lifting your pen from the paper. In other words, there are no breaks or jumps in the graph.</p>
<h3 id="definition-of-continuity">Definition of Continuity</h3>
<p>A function  $ f(x) $  is <strong>continuous at a point</strong>  $ x = a $  if the following three conditions are met:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>** $ f(a) $  is defined:** The function must have a value at  $ x = a $ .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>** $ \lim_{x \to a} f(x) $  exists:** The limit of the function as  $ x $  approaches  $ a $  must exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>** $ \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a) $ :** The limit of the function as  $ x $  approaches  $ a $  must be equal to the value of the function at  $ x = a $ .</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A function is <strong>continuous on an interval</strong> if it is continuous at every point in that interval.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-discontinuities">Types of Discontinuities</h3>
<p>If a function fails to meet one or more of the conditions for continuity at a point, it has a <strong>discontinuity</strong> at that point. There are three main types of discontinuities:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Removable discontinuity:</strong> This occurs when the limit of the function exists as  $ x $  approaches the point of discontinuity, but the function is not defined at that point, or the value of the function at that point is different from the limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jump discontinuity:</strong> This occurs when the limit of the function as  $ x $  approaches the point of discontinuity from the left is different from the limit as  $ x $  approaches from the right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Infinite discontinuity:</strong> This occurs when the limit of the function as  $ x $  approaches the point of discontinuity is either positive or negative infinity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="properties-of-continuous-functions">Properties of Continuous Functions</h3>
<p>Continuous functions have several important properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="./../intermediate-value-theorem/">Intermediate Value Theorem</a>:</strong> If  $ f(x) $  is continuous on the closed interval  $ [a, b] $ , and  $ k $  is any number between  $ f(a) $  and  $ f(b) $ , then there exists at least one number  $ c $  in the interval  $ [a, b] $  such that  $ f(c) = k $ .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="./../extreme-value-theorem/">Extreme Value Theorem</a>:</strong> If  $ f(x) $  is continuous on the closed interval  $ [a, b] $ , then  $ f(x) $  has both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum on that interval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Boundedness Theorem:</strong> If  $ f(x) $  is continuous on the closed interval  $ [a, b] $ , then  $ f(x) $  is bounded on that interval.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="applications-of-continuity">Applications of Continuity</h3>
<p>Continuity is a fundamental concept in calculus that is essential for understanding many important theorems and concepts, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Derivatives:</strong> The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient as  $ x $  approaches that point. This limit only exists if the function is continuous at that point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integrals:</strong> The integral of a function over an interval is defined as the limit of a sum of areas of rectangles as the width of the rectangles approaches zero. This limit only exists if the function is continuous on the interval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Differential equations:</strong> Many differential equations involve continuous functions, and the solutions to these equations are also often continuous functions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Continuity is a fundamental concept in calculus that is essential for understanding many important theorems and concepts. It is also an important concept in other areas of mathematics, such as topology and real analysis.</p>
