<h2 id="when-march-28-1979">WHEN: March 28, 1979</h2>
<h2 id="who">WHO:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Metropolitan Edison (Operator):</strong> The company that owned and operated the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station.</li>
<li><strong>Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC):</strong> The federal agency responsible for regulating and overseeing the nuclear industry in the United States.</li>
<li><strong>President Jimmy Carter:</strong> Oversaw the federal government&rsquo;s response to the crisis.</li>
<li><strong>Residents of Pennsylvania:</strong> Directly affected by the potential health and environmental hazards.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">WHAT:</h2>
<p>A partial meltdown occurred at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. A combination of mechanical failure and human error led to the reactor core overheating and sustaining significant damage.  Although a full meltdown was averted, radioactive gases and iodine were released into the atmosphere.</p>
<h2 id="impact">IMPACT:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Public Fear:</strong>  Fueled widespread public anxiety and distrust regarding nuclear power and its safety.</li>
<li><strong>Stricter Regulations:</strong> Led to significant changes in NRC regulations and oversight, including increased safety measures, improved operator training, and emergency planning requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Decline in Nuclear Power:</strong>  Significantly hampered the growth of the nuclear power industry in the US; no new nuclear power plants were commissioned for decades following the accident. Many planned reactors were cancelled.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Movement:</strong> Strengthened the environmental movement, highlighting the potential dangers of industrial accidents and the need for greater environmental protection.</li>
<li><strong>Emergency Response Planning:</strong> Showed the inadequacy of existing emergency response plans and led to better preparedness and coordination among federal, state, and local agencies.</li>
<li><strong>Lasting Cleanup:</strong>  The cleanup operation was lengthy and costly, taking years and millions of dollars.</li>
</ul>
