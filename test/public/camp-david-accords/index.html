<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A peace treaty signed by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin on September 17, 1978, following twelve days of secret negotiations at Camp David, the U.S. Presidential retreat in Maryland. The Accords comprised two framework agreements: “A Framework for Peace in the Middle East” and “A Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel”.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Peace Treaty:</strong> Led directly to the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty, the first peace agreement between Israel and an Arab nation.</li>
<li><strong>Nobel Peace Prize:</strong> Sadat and Begin were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978 for their efforts. Carter received it later in 2002.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in Regional Dynamics:</strong> Marked a significant shift in the political landscape of the Middle East. Egypt, previously a staunch adversary of Israel, moved towards a more cooperative relationship.</li>
<li><strong>Egyptian Isolation:</strong> Egypt faced criticism and isolation from other Arab nations for making peace with Israel.</li>
<li><strong>Assassination of Sadat:</strong> Anwar Sadat was assassinated in 1981 by Islamic extremists who opposed the peace treaty.</li>
<li><strong>Framework for Future Negotiations:</strong> Served as a framework for future negotiations and peace efforts between Israel and its Arab neighbors, although progress has been limited.</li>
<li><strong>US Role in Middle East:</strong> Highlighted the growing role of the United States as a mediator and power broker in the Middle East.</li>
