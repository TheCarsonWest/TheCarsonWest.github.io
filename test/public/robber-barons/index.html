</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>Powerful industrialists who amassed immense fortunes through often ruthless business practices during the <a href="./../gilded-age/">Gilded Age</a>.  They controlled major sectors of the American economy, employing tactics such as monopolies, trusts, and horizontal/vertical integration to eliminate competition and maximize profits.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Industrial Growth:</strong>  Fueled unprecedented industrial expansion and economic growth in the U.S.  Created massive wealth, but this wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few.</li>
<li><strong>Monopolies and Trusts:</strong> Created massive monopolies and trusts which stifled competition and controlled prices. This led to public outcry and calls for government regulation.</li>
<li><strong>Social Inequality:</strong>  Exacerbated social inequality, creating a vast gap between the wealthy elite and the working class.  This disparity fueled labor movements and social unrest.</li>
<li><strong>Philanthropy:</strong> Many engaged in philanthropy, donating large sums of money to libraries, universities, and other institutions (though this is often seen as an attempt to improve their public image and deflect criticism).</li>
<li><strong>Government Regulation:</strong> Their actions ultimately led to increased government regulation of businesses and the rise of anti-trust legislation (e.g., the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, though initially weakly enforced).</li>
<li><strong>Shaped American Capitalism:</strong> Their methods and influence fundamentally shaped the development of American capitalism and continue to be debated in terms of their positive and negative impacts.</li>
