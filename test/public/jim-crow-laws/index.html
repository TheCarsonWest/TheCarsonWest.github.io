<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<p>Southern White <a href="./../democrats/">Democrats</a> (primarily, but some Black people were involved in the system as well)</p>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A system of state and local laws enacted in the Southern and some border states of the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> between 1877 and the mid-1960s. These laws were designed to disenfranchise and segregate African Americans. They included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Voting Restrictions:</strong> Poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses, and white primaries.</li>
<li><strong>Segregation:</strong> Separate public facilities (schools, restrooms, transportation, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Economic Disparities:</strong>  Limited employment opportunities, sharecropping, and unequal access to resources.</li>
<li><strong>Violence and Intimidation:</strong> Lynching, mob violence, and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perpetuation of Racial Inequality:</strong> Jim Crow laws solidified racial segregation and inequality in the South. They denied African Americans basic rights and opportunities, undermining the gains made during Reconstruction.</li>
<li><strong>Suppression of Black Political Power:</strong> These laws effectively disenfranchise Black voters and prevented them from participating in the political process.</li>
<li><strong>Rise of Civil Rights Movement:</strong>  The enduring injustices of Jim Crow laws fueled the Civil Rights Movement of the mid-20th century, which ultimately led to the passage of landmark legislation like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Lasting Legacy:</strong> Even after the legal dismantling of Jim Crow, its legacy of racial disparities in areas like education, healthcare, and criminal justice continues to impact the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> today.</li>
