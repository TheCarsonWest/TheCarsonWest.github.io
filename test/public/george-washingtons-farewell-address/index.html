<h2 id="when-september-17-1796">When: September 17, 1796</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author:</strong>  George Washington</li>
<li><strong>Intended Audience:</strong> The American people</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A letter published in newspapers, announcing Washington&rsquo;s decision not to seek a third term as President. It went beyond simply declining reelection; it became a foundational document outlining Washington&rsquo;s advice for the future of the nation.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact? Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Established Precedent of Two-Term Presidency:</strong> Though not a law until the 22nd Amendment (1951), Washington&rsquo;s decision set a powerful tradition followed by presidents until Franklin D. Roosevelt.</li>
<li><strong>Warning Against Political Parties:</strong> Washington feared factions would divide the nation and urged unity. This warning, though often unheeded, highlighted the potential dangers of partisanship.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy for Neutrality in Foreign Affairs:</strong> Emphasized avoiding &ldquo;entangling alliances&rdquo; with European powers, advocating for a focus on domestic issues and neutrality in foreign conflicts. This shaped early American foreign policy.</li>
<li><strong>Cements Washington&rsquo;s Legacy:</strong> Solidified his image as a selfless leader devoted to the republic&rsquo;s success. His warnings about national unity and foreign entanglements continue to resonate in American political discourse.</li>
