This occurs because the vapor phase has the same composition as the liquid phase at a specific boiling point.  In essence, the liquid and vapor behave as a single component, making separation by [[Distillation]] impossible.</h1>
<h2 id="types-of-azeotropes">Types of [[Azeotropes]]</h2>
<p>There are two main types:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Minimum-boiling azeotropes:</strong> These boil at a lower temperature than either of their pure components.  The [[intermolecular forces]] between the components are weaker than those within the pure components, leading to a lower boiling point.  An example is ethanol and water (95.[[6]]% ethanol).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maximum-boiling azeotropes:</strong> These boil at a higher temperature than either of their pure components.  Stronger [[intermolecular forces]] between the components than within the pure components result in a higher boiling point.  An example is hydrochloric acid and water.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vapor-pressure-and-raoults-law-deviation">[[Vapor Pressure]] and [[Raoults Law]] Deviation</h2>
<p>Understanding azeotropes requires examining deviations from [[Raoults Law]].  [[Raoults Law]] states that the [[partial pressure]] of a component in an ideal solution is proportional to its mole fraction and its [[vapor pressure]] in the pure state:</p>
<p>$ P_i = x_i P_i^* $</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>$ P_i $  is the [[partial pressure]] of component  $ i $</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$ x_i $  is the mole fraction of component  $ i $</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$ P_i^* $  is the [[vapor pressure]] of pure component  $ i $
[[Azeotropes]] form because of significant deviations from [[Raoults Law]].  These deviations can be:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Positive deviations:</strong>  The [[intermolecular forces]] between unlike molecules are weaker than those between like molecules.  This leads to a higher total [[vapor pressure]] than predicted by [[Raoults Law]], resulting in minimum-boiling azeotropes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Negative deviations:</strong> The [[intermolecular forces]] between unlike molecules are stronger than those between like molecules. This leads to a lower total [[vapor pressure]] than predicted by [[Raoults Law]], resulting in maximum-boiling azeotropes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="breaking-azeotropes">Breaking [[Azeotropes]]</h2>
<p>Since simple [[Distillation]] fails, other methods are needed to separate azeotropic mixtures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pressure-swing [[Distillation]]:</strong> Changing the pressure alters the azeotropic composition, allowing for separation through multiple [[Distillation]] steps at different pressures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adding a third component (entrainer):</strong> An entrainer is added to form a new azeotrope with one of the original components, making separation possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Membrane separation:</strong>  Utilizing selective membranes to separate components based on differences in their size or properties.</p>
</li>
</ul>
