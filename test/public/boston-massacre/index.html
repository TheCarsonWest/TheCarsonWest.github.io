<h2 id="when-march-5-1770">When: March 5, 1770</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>British Soldiers:</strong>  Part of the 29th Regiment of Foot, under the command of Captain Thomas Preston.</li>
<li><strong>Colonists:</strong> A crowd of mostly working-class Bostonians, including Crispus Attucks (a crucial figure often cited as the first to die).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A violent confrontation between British soldiers and a group of colonists in Boston, <a href="./../massachusetts/">Massachusetts</a>.  The incident began with escalating tensions and taunts between the colonists and the soldiers.  The soldiers fired into the crowd, killing five colonists and wounding several others.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Propaganda:</strong> The <a href="./../boston-massacre/">Boston Massacre</a> became a powerful symbol of British oppression used by colonial revolutionaries to rally support for their cause.  Paul Revere&rsquo;s famous engraving greatly exaggerated the event to further this purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Tensions:</strong> The incident significantly heightened tensions between <a href="./../great-britain/">Great Britain</a> and the American colonies, pushing the relationship closer to armed conflict.</li>
<li><strong>Martyrdom:</strong> The deaths of the colonists fueled anti-British sentiment and solidified the narrative of British tyranny. Crispus Attucksâ€™s death, in particular, became a powerful rallying cry.</li>
<li><strong>Trial and Aftermath:</strong>  Captain Preston and several soldiers were put on trial.  While some were convicted of manslaughter, the event demonstrated the legal complexities and the political climate of the time.</li>
<li><strong>Stepping Stone to Revolution:</strong> The <a href="./../boston-massacre/">Boston Massacre</a> is viewed as one of several key events leading to the American Revolutionary War. It galvanized colonial resistance and further eroded trust in British rule.</li>
