<h1 id="id-embargo-act-of-1807">ID: Embargo Act of 1807</h1>
<h2 id="when-december-22-1807">When: December 22, 1807</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proposed by:</strong> President <a href="./../thomas-jefferson/">Thomas Jefferson</a></li>
<li><strong>Passed by:</strong> U.S. Congress</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>An act that prohibited American ships from sailing to any foreign port. This was in response to the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, where a British ship attacked an American ship and impressed American sailors into the British Navy.  Jefferson hoped the embargo would pressure Britain and <a href="./../france/">France</a> (who were at war) to respect American neutrality and stop impressing American sailors.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact? Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Devastated the U.S. economy:</strong> Severely hurt American shipping and agriculture, especially in New England, leading to widespread economic hardship and smuggling.</li>
<li><strong>Politically damaging to Jefferson:</strong> Eroded support for the Democratic-Republican Party, particularly in the Northeast.</li>
<li><strong>Contributed to the <a href="./../war-of-1812/">War of 1812</a>:</strong> Heightened tensions with Britain, eventually contributing to the outbreak of war in 1812.</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrated the limits of peaceful coercion:</strong> Showed that economic pressure alone was insufficient to protect American interests on the high seas.</li>
<li><strong>Spurred domestic industrial growth:</strong> Forced the U.S. to become more self-sufficient by encouraging the growth of domestic manufacturing, though on a limited scale.</li>
</ul>
