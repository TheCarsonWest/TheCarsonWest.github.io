<p><strong>I. Core Components:</strong></p>
<p>A strong thesis statement generally includes these three elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Specific Claim:</strong>  A clear and focused assertion, not a general observation.  Avoid vague language.  Instead of &ldquo;Shakespeare was a great writer,&rdquo; try something like &ldquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s use of iambic pentameter in Hamlet contributes to the play&rsquo;s dramatic tension.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reasoning/Roadmap:</strong>  Briefly indicates the main points or arguments that will support your claim. This acts as a roadmap for your essay.  For example,  &ldquo;&hellip;by highlighting internal conflict, foreshadowing key events, and creating a sense of inevitability.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scope/Limits:</strong>  Implicitly or explicitly defines the boundaries of your argument.  What aspects of the topic will you address?  What will you not address?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>II. Types of Thesis Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Argumentative:</strong>  Presents a debatable claim and aims to persuade the reader.  Example: &ldquo;The rising cost of higher education in the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> is primarily driven by escalating administrative expenses, not faculty salaries.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analytical:</strong>  Examines a topic, breaking it down into its constituent parts and exploring the relationships between them. Example:  &ldquo;Toni Morrison&rsquo;s Beloved utilizes elements of magical realism to explore the lingering trauma of slavery and its impact on individual and collective identity.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="./../expository-thesis/">Expository Thesis</a>:  Explains or informs the reader about a topic.  Example: &ldquo;The process of photosynthesis involves three key stages: light absorption, electron transport, and carbon fixation.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III.  Formulating a Thesis:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Start with a question:</strong>  What is the central question you are trying to answer?  Your thesis statement should be a direct response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Brainstorm and research:</strong>  Gather information to support your potential claims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Refine and revise:</strong>  Your initial thesis might need adjustments as you develop your argument.  (<a href="./../thesis-revision-process/">Thesis Revision Process</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check for clarity and focus:</strong>  Is your thesis statement concise, specific, and easy to understand?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>IV. Common Mistakes to Avoid:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Too broad:</strong>  The claim is too general to be adequately addressed within the essay&rsquo;s scope.</li>
<li><strong>Too narrow:</strong>  The claim is so specific that it limits the potential for analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Unclear or vague language:</strong>  The claim is ambiguous and doesn&rsquo;t clearly state a position.</li>
<li><strong>Unsupported assertions:</strong>  The claim cannot be substantiated with evidence.</li>
<li><strong>Mere opinion:</strong>  The claim is subjective and lacks analytical depth.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>VI. Example Thesis Breakdown:</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s analyze this thesis: &ldquo;The portrayal of women in Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies reveals a complex interplay between societal expectations, individual agency, and tragic consequences, as evidenced by the characters of Lady Macbeth, Ophelia, and Desdemona.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specific Claim:</strong> The portrayal of women in Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies reveals a complex interplay between societal expectations, individual agency, and tragic consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Reasoning/Roadmap:</strong>  &hellip;as evidenced by the characters of Lady Macbeth, Ophelia, and Desdemona.  (This implies a comparative analysis of these characters.)</li>
<li><strong>Scope/Limits:</strong> Focuses on women in Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies and uses three specific characters as examples.  It doesn&rsquo;t address comedies or other aspects of Shakespeare&rsquo;s work.</li>
</ul>
<p>This thesis is strong because it is specific, offers a clear line of reasoning, and limits its scope.</p>
