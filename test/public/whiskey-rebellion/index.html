<p><strong>IMPACT:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengthening of Federal Authority:</strong> The successful suppression of the rebellion demonstrated the federal government&rsquo;s ability to enforce its laws.</li>
<li><strong>Expansion of Presidential Power:</strong> [[Washington]]&rsquo;s action to raise an army and lead it into the field extended the presidential role as commander-in-chief.</li>
<li><strong>Political Divide:</strong> The [[Whiskey Rebellion]] exposed deep divisions within the [[United States]] over the issue of federal taxation and the scope of government power.</li>
<li><strong>Rise of Anti-Federalist Sentiment:</strong> The rebellion further alienated Western states from the federal government, strengthening Anti-Federalist opposition.</li>
