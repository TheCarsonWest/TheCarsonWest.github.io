<p>When we believe a linear relationship exists between two quantitative variables, we often use a <a href="./../linear-regression-models/">Linear Regression Models</a> to model this relationship. However, the observed slope from a sample ( $ \hat{b} $ ) might just be due to random chance, even if there&rsquo;s no true linear relationship in the population. A hypothesis test for the slope of a regression model allows us to determine if there is statistically significant evidence of a linear relationship between the two variables in the population.</p>
<h2 id="purpose-of-the-test">Purpose of the Test</h2>
<p>The primary goal of this test is to assess whether the explanatory variable ( $ x $ ) has a statistically significant linear association with the response variable ( $ y $ ) in the population. If the true population slope ( $ \beta $ ) is zero, it implies that there is no linear relationship between  $ x $  and  $ y $ .</p>
<h2 id="hypotheses">Hypotheses</h2>
<p>The hypotheses for testing the slope of a regression model are stated in terms of the population regression slope,  $ \beta $ .</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Null Hypothesis ( $ H_0 $ )</strong>: There is no linear relationship between the explanatory variable ( $ x $ ) and the response variable ( $ y $ ) in the population.
$$ H_0: \beta = 0 $$      This means that the true slope of the population regression line is zero.</li>
<li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis ( $ H_a $ )</strong>: There is a linear relationship between the explanatory variable ( $ x $ ) and the response variable ( $ y $ ) in the population. The alternative hypothesis can be one-sided or two-sided, depending on the research question.
<ul>
<li>Two-sided: The slope is not zero.
$$ H_a: \beta \neq 0 $$      *   One-sided (positive relationship): The slope is greater than zero.
$$ H_a: \beta &gt; 0 $$      *   One-sided (negative relationship): The slope is less than zero.
$$ H_a: \beta &lt; 0 $$</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conditions-for-inference">Conditions for Inference</h2>
<p>Before carrying out a test for the slope of a regression model, several conditions must be met to ensure the validity of the results. These are often remembered by the acronym <strong>LINER</strong>:</p>

<p>If these conditions are not reasonably met, the inference procedure for the slope may not be appropriate, and the conclusions drawn could be unreliable.</p>
<h2 id="test-statistic">Test Statistic</h2>
<p>The test statistic for the slope of a regression model is a  $ t $ -statistic. It measures how many standard errors the observed sample slope ( $ \hat{b} $ ) is away from the hypothesized population slope (typically 0).</p>
<p>The formula for the test statistic is:</p>
<p>$$ t = \frac{\hat{b} - \beta_0}{SE_{\hat{b}}} $$<br>
Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ \hat{b} $  is the sample slope (estimate of  $ \beta $ ).</li>
<li>$ \beta_0 $  is the hypothesized population slope (usually 0 under  $ H_0 $ ).</li>
<li>$ SE_{\hat{b}} $  is the standard error of the slope. This value is typically provided in the regression output from statistical software.</li>
</ul>
<p>The degrees of freedom for this  $ t $ -distribution are  $ df = n - 2 $ , where  $ n $  is the number of observations in the sample.</p>
<p>This test is often referred to as a  $ t $ -test for the slope. Once the test statistic is calculated, it can be used to find the <a href="./../interpreting-p-values%7Cp-value/">Interpreting p-Values|p-value</a> to make a decision regarding the null hypothesis, as outlined in <a href="./../carrying-out-a-test-for-the-slope-of-a-regression-model/">Carrying Out a Test for the Slope of a Regression Model</a>.</p>
