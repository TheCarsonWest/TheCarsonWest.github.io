<li><strong>[[Urbanization]]:</strong>  Rapid growth of cities, leading to overcrowding, poverty, and social problems.</li>
<li><strong>Immigration:</strong>  Massive waves of immigration, leading to cultural diversity but also social tensions and discrimination.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>[[Transcontinental Railroad]] Completion (1869):</strong>  Symbolizes industrial expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Sherman Antitrust Act (1890):</strong>  Attempted to curb the power of monopolies, though largely ineffective initially.</li>
<li><strong>Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act (1883):</strong>  Addressed political corruption by introducing merit-based hiring for government jobs.</li>
