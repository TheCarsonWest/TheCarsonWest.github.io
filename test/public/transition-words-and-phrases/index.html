<p><strong>Mathematical Representation of Transition Types (Conceptual):</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s represent the transition types as sets:   $ A = {\text{Addition}} $ ,  $ C = {\text{Contrast}} $ ,  $ E = {\text{Examples}} $ , etc.</p>
<p>A complex sentence could then be represented as a combination of these sets.  For example, a sentence with both addition and contrast could be denoted as  $ A \cup C $ .  The number of elements in the set would represent the number of transition words/phrases used within a sentence or paragraph.  This is a simplistic representation, and doesn&rsquo;t account for the nuances of language.  Further analysis would require more sophisticated linguistic modeling.</p>
<h2 id="--textsentence-complexity-propto-bigcup_i-s_i--">$$  \text{Sentence Complexity} \propto |\bigcup_{i} S_i|  $$</h2>
<p>Where  $ S_i $  represents the set of transition types used in a sentence, and  $ |\bigcup_{i} S_i| $  represents the cardinality (number of elements) of the union of all transition type sets.  This equation suggests that sentence complexity increases with the number of different transition types used.</p>
