<h2 id="when-pre-1880-old-immigration-vs-post-1880-new-immigration">When: Pre-1880 (Old Immigration) vs. Post-1880 (New Immigration)</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Old Immigrants:</strong> Primarily Northern and Western Europeans (English, Irish, Germans, Scandinavians).</li>
<li><strong>New Immigrants:</strong> Primarily Southern and Eastern Europeans (Italians, Poles, Russians, Greeks, Austro-Hungarians), as well as Asians (Chinese, Japanese).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Old Immigration:</strong>  A period of immigration characterized by relatively smaller numbers of immigrants primarily from Northern and Western Europe.  These immigrants often had some English language skills and were largely Protestant.  They tended to settle in rural areas and were often more easily assimilated into American society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New Immigration:</strong> A period of massive immigration characterized by a huge influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe and Asia. These immigrants often spoke little to no English, were largely Catholic, Jewish, or Orthodox, and faced significant cultural differences. They often settled in urban areas, leading to overcrowding and the creation of distinct ethnic enclaves.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shifting Demographics:</strong> The New Immigration dramatically changed the ethnic and religious makeup of the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>, leading to increased social tensions and nativism (anti-immigrant sentiment).</li>
<li><strong>Urban Growth:</strong> The concentration of New Immigrants in urban centers fueled rapid urban growth and contributed to the development of distinct ethnic neighborhoods.</li>
<li><strong>Rise of Nativism:</strong>  Fear of the &ldquo;new&rdquo; immigrants led to increased nativism, resulting in discriminatory laws and practices like the <a href="./../chinese-exclusion-act/">Chinese Exclusion Act</a> of 1882,  the rise of organizations like the American Protective Association (APA), and restrictions on immigration based on national origin and literacy tests.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Issues:</strong> New Immigrants often filled low-wage jobs, leading to competition with native-born workers and contributing to labor unrest and strikes.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural Diversity:</strong> While leading to conflict, the New Immigration also enriched American culture, introducing new foods, languages, customs, and artistic expressions.</li>
<li><strong>Political Changes:</strong> The large numbers of new immigrants eventually led to changes in the political landscape, with some immigrant groups gaining political power and influence.</li>
