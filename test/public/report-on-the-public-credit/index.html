<h2 id="when-january-1790">When: January 1790</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proposed by:</strong> <a href="./../alexander-hamilton/">Alexander Hamilton</a>, the first Secretary of the Treasury</li>
<li><strong>Presented to:</strong> Congress</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A plan to address the national debt incurred during the American Revolution.  The key elements were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Funding the national debt:</strong> The federal government would assume all state debts at face value.</li>
<li><strong>Assumption of state debts:</strong>  States with large debts (mostly in the North) favored this, while Southern states with smaller debts were opposed.</li>
<li><strong>Creating a national bank:</strong>  A central bank would help manage the nation&rsquo;s finances and issue a stable currency.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact? Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengthened the national government:</strong>  By taking on state debts, the federal government gained more power and influence.</li>
<li><strong>Promoted economic growth:</strong>  Establishing a stable financial system encouraged investment and trade.</li>
<li><strong>Fueled partisan divisions:</strong> The report sparked intense debate between Federalists (who supported Hamilton&rsquo;s plan) and Democratic-Republicans (who opposed its expansion of federal power), foreshadowing the two-party system.</li>
<li><strong>Compromise &amp; the &ldquo;Dinner Table bargain&rdquo;:</strong> Led to a compromise where the South agreed to assumption in exchange for the nation&rsquo;s capital being located in the South (<a href="./../washington/">Washington</a> D.C.). This demonstrated the growing <a href="./../sectionalism/">sectionalism</a> in the new nation.</li>
