<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>Booker T. Washington delivered the &ldquo;Atlanta Compromise&rdquo; speech at the Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta.  This speech advocated for African Americans to focus on vocational education and economic self-reliance, temporarily accepting social segregation, in order to gain the trust and respect of white society.  He argued that achieving economic independence would eventually lead to greater social and political equality.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shaped African American Strategy:</strong> The Atlanta Compromise became a highly influential framework for African American advancement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It shaped the direction of Black educational institutions and community development efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Controversial Legacy:</strong>  The compromise was immediately controversial. Critics, including W.E.B. Du Bois, argued that it perpetuated racial segregation and undermined the fight for immediate civil rights.  It fostered a debate within the African American community about the best path to equality.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Progress:</strong> While it did lead to some economic advancement for some African Americans, the Atlanta Compromise ultimately did little to address the pervasive racial discrimination and violence they faced.  It represented a pragmatic, but ultimately limited, approach to achieving racial equality.</li>
<li><strong>Foundation for later movements:</strong>  The debate sparked by the compromise laid groundwork for the later activism and civil rights struggles of the early 20th century, and the rise of alternative approaches like the Niagara Movement (Du Bois) that rejected the gradualist approach advocated by Washington.</li>
