In May 1902, a key component of this was his intervention in the Great Coal Strike, threatening to use federal troops to seize the mines unless both sides agreed to arbitration.</h2>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">IMPACT: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government Intervention in Labor Disputes:</strong>  Roosevelt&rsquo;s intervention marked a significant shift in the federal government&rsquo;s role, demonstrating a willingness to mediate between labor and capital, rather than simply siding with business interests (as had been the common practice).</li>
<li><strong>Arbitration as a Tool:</strong>  The successful arbitration of the coal strike established arbitration as a legitimate means of resolving labor disputes, a precedent used in later conflicts.</li>
<li><strong>Public Support for Roosevelt:</strong> Roosevelt&rsquo;s action significantly boosted his popularity, portraying him as a champion of the &ldquo;common man&rdquo; and someone who could stand up to powerful corporations. This contributed to his re-election in 1904 and strengthened the Progressive movement.</li>
<li><strong>Foundation for Trust-Busting:</strong> The Square Deal laid the groundwork for Roosevelt&rsquo;s later trust-busting efforts, as he aimed to curb the power of monopolies and create a fairer economic playing field.  It demonstrated his belief in regulating big business for the benefit of society.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Presidential Power:</strong> Roosevelt&rsquo;s actions expanded the power and influence of the presidency in domestic affairs, establishing a precedent for future presidents to intervene in economic and social issues.</li>
