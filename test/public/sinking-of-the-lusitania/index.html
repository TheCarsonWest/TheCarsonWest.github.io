<h2 id="when-may-7-1915">When: May 7, 1915</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Victim:</strong> Passengers and crew of the British passenger liner Lusitania (including 128 Americans)</li>
<li><strong>Attacker:</strong> German U-boat (Unterseeboot) U-20</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A German U-boat torpedoed the British ocean liner Lusitania off the coast of Ireland. The Lusitania was carrying both passengers and munitions (a fact that the Germans used to justify the attack). The sinking resulted in a large loss of life, including many American citizens.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Anti-German Sentiment in the U.S.:</strong> The sinking galvanized public opinion in the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> against Germany.  The loss of American lives fueled calls for war.</li>
<li><strong>Strained U.S.-German Relations:</strong> The incident significantly worsened relations between the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> and Germany, pushing the U.S. closer to entering World War I.</li>
<li><strong>Wilson&rsquo;s Response:</strong> President <a href="./../woodrow-wilson/">Woodrow Wilson</a> initially protested the attack and demanded that Germany cease unrestricted submarine warfare.  While he pursued diplomatic solutions for a time, the sinking ultimately contributed to the U.S. declaration of war in 1917.</li>
<li><strong>Propaganda:</strong> The event was heavily used as propaganda by the Allied powers to sway public opinion against Germany.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in Public Opinion:</strong> Though initially leaning towards neutrality, the sinking swayed a significant portion of the American public towards intervention in the war.  This shift in public opinion became a key factor influencing the government&rsquo;s eventual decision to join the conflict.</li>
