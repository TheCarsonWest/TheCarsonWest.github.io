<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>President <a href="./../andrew-johnson/">Andrew Johnson</a>:</strong>  Vetoed the bill, but Congress overrode his veto.</li>
<li><strong>Radical <a href="./../republicans/">Republicans</a>:</strong>  Led the push for the act as part of their Reconstruction plans.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>The <a href="./../tenure-of-office-act/">Tenure of Office Act</a> prohibited the president from removing any federal official who had been appointed by the Senate, without Senate approval. This act was specifically aimed at limiting President Johnson&rsquo;s power to remove his political opponents from office.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impeachment of <a href="./../andrew-johnson/">Andrew Johnson</a>:</strong> The act directly led to Johnson&rsquo;s impeachment by the House of Representatives in 1868. He was acquitted by the Senate by a single vote, but the act contributed significantly to the increasing tension between the president and Congress during Reconstruction.</li>
<li><strong>Presidential Power:</strong> The <a href="./../tenure-of-office-act/">Tenure of Office Act</a>  was a major challenge to presidential power, as it limited the ability of the president to remove officials who disagreed with his policies.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy:</strong> While repealed in 1887, the act is a significant example of the political struggles of Reconstruction and the power dynamics between the legislative and executive branches.  It also represents a key example of how Congress attempted to limit the president&rsquo;s power during a time of great social and political change.</li>
