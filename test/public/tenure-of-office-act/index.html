<h2 id="when-march-2-1867">When: March 2, 1867</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>President Andrew Johnson:</strong>  Vetoed the bill, but Congress overrode his veto.</li>
<li><strong>Radical Republicans:</strong>  Led the push for the act as part of their Reconstruction plans.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>The Tenure of Office Act prohibited the president from removing any federal official who had been appointed by the Senate, without Senate approval. This act was specifically aimed at limiting President Johnson&rsquo;s power to remove his political opponents from office.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impeachment of Andrew Johnson:</strong> The act directly led to Johnson&rsquo;s impeachment by the House of Representatives in 1868. He was acquitted by the Senate by a single vote, but the act contributed significantly to the increasing tension between the president and Congress during Reconstruction.</li>
<li><strong>Presidential Power:</strong> The Tenure of Office Act  was a major challenge to presidential power, as it limited the ability of the president to remove officials who disagreed with his policies.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy:</strong> While repealed in 1887, the act is a significant example of the political struggles of Reconstruction and the power dynamics between the legislative and executive branches.  It also represents a key example of how Congress attempted to limit the president&rsquo;s power during a time of great social and political change.</li>
