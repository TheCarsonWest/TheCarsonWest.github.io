<h1 id="franklin-pierce-a-rundown">Franklin Pierce: A Rundown</h1>
<p>Franklin Pierce (1804-1869) was the 14th <a href="./../potus/">POTUS</a>, serving from 1853 to 1857. His presidency was largely overshadowed by the growing <a href="./../sectionalism/">sectionalism</a> in the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> leading up to the <a href="./../civil-war/">Civil War</a>.</p>
<h2 id="key-events-and-associations">Key Events and Associations:</h2>

<li>Served as a brigadier general in the Mexican-American War, though his military record was mixed.</li>
<li><strong>Election of 1852:</strong></li>
<li>Pierce was a &ldquo;dark horse&rdquo; candidate nominated by the <a href="./../democrats/">Democrats</a> after multiple ballots.</li>
<li>He benefited from being seen as a compromise candidate acceptable to both Northern and Southern factions of the party.</li>
<li>He won a landslide victory against <a href="./../william-mckinley/">William McKinley</a>.</li>
<li><strong>The <a href="./../kansas-nebraska-act/">Kansas-Nebraska Act</a> (1854):</strong></li>
<li>This act, supported by Pierce, repealed the <a href="./../missouri-compromise/">Missouri Compromise</a> and allowed for <a href="./../popular-sovereignty/">Popular Sovereignty</a> in the territories of Kansas and <a href="./../nebraska/">Nebraska</a>.</li>
<li>It led to widespread violence in Kansas (&quot;<a href="./../bleeding-kansas/">Bleeding Kansas</a>&quot;) and further inflamed sectional tensions.</li>
<li><strong>Gadsden Purchase (1853):</strong></li>
<li>Pierce authorized the purchase of a strip of land from Mexico for  $ 10 million.</li>
<li>This land was intended to facilitate the construction of a transcontinental railroad along a southern route.</li>
<li><strong>Ostend Manifesto (1854):</strong></li>
<li>This document, drafted by U.S. diplomats in Europe, suggested that the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> should seize <a href="./../cuba/">Cuba</a> from <a href="./../spain/">Spain</a> if <a href="./../spain/">Spain</a> refused to sell it.</li>
<li>The manifesto was controversial and further fueled concerns about the expansion of slavery.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Young America&rdquo; Movement:</strong></li>
<li>Pierce was sympathetic to this movement, which advocated for U.S. expansion and influence abroad.</li>
<li>It reflected a belief in American exceptionalism and a desire to spread democracy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="important-legislation-signed">Important Legislation Signed:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./../kansas-nebraska-act/">Kansas-Nebraska Act</a> (1854)</strong> (As mentioned above)</li>
<li><strong>Gadsden Purchase Treaty (1853)</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="groups-and-affiliations">Groups and Affiliations:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./../democrats/">Democrats</a>:</strong> Pierce was a staunch member of the <a href="./../democrats/">Democrats</a> and believed in states&rsquo; rights and limited federal government.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-on-the-country">Impact on the Country:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Negative Impact on Sectional Tensions:</strong> Pierce&rsquo;s support for the <a href="./../kansas-nebraska-act/">Kansas-Nebraska Act</a> is widely considered a major factor in escalating the conflict between the North and South. His actions deepened the divide over slavery and pushed the nation closer to <a href="./../civil-war/">Civil War</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Weakening of the <a href="./../democrats/">Democrats</a>:</strong> The controversy surrounding the <a href="./../kansas-nebraska-act/">Kansas-Nebraska Act</a> split the <a href="./../democrats/">Democrats</a> and weakened their ability to govern effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Rise of the <a href="./../new-republican-party-1850%7Crepublican-party/">New Republican Party 1850|Republican Party</a>:</strong> The furor over the <a href="./../kansas-nebraska-act/">Kansas-Nebraska Act</a> led to the formation of the <a href="./../new-republican-party-1850/">New Republican Party 1850</a>, which opposed the expansion of slavery.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Policy Controversies:</strong> The <a href="./../ostend-manifesto/">Ostend Manifesto</a> damaged the credibility of the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> on the international stage and raised concerns about American imperialism.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, <a href="./../franklin-pierce/">Franklin Pierce</a>&rsquo;s presidency is generally viewed as a failure due to his handling of the slavery issue and its contribution to the growing <a href="./../sectionalism/">sectionalism</a> that led to the <a href="./../civil-war/">Civil War</a>.</p>
