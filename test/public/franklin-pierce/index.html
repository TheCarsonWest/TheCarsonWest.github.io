<p>Franklin Pierce (1804-1869) was the 14th [[POTUS]], serving from 1853 to 1857. His presidency was largely overshadowed by the growing [[sectionalism]] in the [[United States]] leading up to the [[Civil War]].</p>

<li><strong>Gadsden Purchase (1853):</strong></li>
<li>Pierce authorized the purchase of a strip of land from Mexico for  $ 10 million.</li>
<li>This land was intended to facilitate the construction of a transcontinental railroad along a southern route.</li>
<li><strong>Ostend Manifesto (1854):</strong></li>
<li>This document, drafted by U.S. diplomats in Europe, suggested that the [[United States]] should seize [[Cuba]] from [[Spain]] if [[Spain]] refused to sell it.</li>
<li>The manifesto was controversial and further fueled concerns about the expansion of slavery.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Young America&rdquo; Movement:</strong></li>
<li>Pierce was sympathetic to this movement, which advocated for U.S. expansion and influence abroad.</li>
<li>It reflected a belief in American exceptionalism and a desire to spread democracy.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="impact-on-the-country">Impact on the Country:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Negative Impact on Sectional Tensions:</strong> Pierce&rsquo;s support for the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] is widely considered a major factor in escalating the conflict between the North and South. His actions deepened the divide over slavery and pushed the nation closer to [[Civil War]].</li>
<li><strong>Weakening of the [[Democrats]]:</strong> The controversy surrounding the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] split the [[Democrats]] and weakened their ability to govern effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Rise of the [[New Republican Party 1850|Republican Party]]:</strong> The furor over the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] led to the formation of the [[New Republican Party 1850]], which opposed the expansion of slavery.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Policy Controversies:</strong> The [[Ostend Manifesto]] damaged the credibility of the [[United States]] on the international stage and raised concerns about American imperialism.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, [[Franklin Pierce]]&rsquo;s presidency is generally viewed as a failure due to his handling of the slavery issue and its contribution to the growing [[sectionalism]] that led to the [[Civil War]].</p>
