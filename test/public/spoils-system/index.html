<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>The <a href="./../spoils-system/">Spoils System</a> was a practice where victorious political parties would reward their supporters with government jobs. This practice often involved replacing existing government employees with loyal party members, regardless of their qualifications.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Political Patronage:</strong>  The system significantly increased the power of political parties and contributed to the growth of <a href="./../political-machines/">Political Machines</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Government Efficiency:</strong> Replacing qualified employees with unqualified party loyalists often decreased government efficiency and effectiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Corruption and Scandal:</strong>  The <a href="./../spoils-system/">Spoils System</a> created opportunities for corruption and scandal as positions were often granted based on loyalty rather than merit.</li>
<li><strong>Civil Service Reform:</strong> The system&rsquo;s negative consequences eventually led to calls for reform, culminating in the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 which established a merit-based system for hiring government employees.</li>
