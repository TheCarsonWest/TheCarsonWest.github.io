<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s a notecard following your format on the Geneva Accords:</p>
<h2 id="id-geneva-accordsgeneva-accords">ID: <a href="./../geneva-accords/">Geneva Accords</a></h2>
<h2 id="when-july-21-1954">When: July 21, 1954</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Representatives from: France, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, the State of Vietnam (Bao Dai&rsquo;s government), the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh&rsquo;s government), Laos, and Cambodia. The <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> was an observer but did not sign.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<ul>
<li>A set of agreements that temporarily divided Vietnam into two zones: a northern zone to be governed by the Viet Minh (Ho Chi Minh&rsquo;s communist forces), and a southern zone to be governed by the State of Vietnam (later, the Republic of Vietnam).</li>
<li>Called for a general election to be held in July 1956 to reunify the country under a single government.</li>
<li>Guaranteed the independence of Laos and Cambodia.</li>
<li>Provided for the regrouping of forces and the exchange of prisoners.</li>
<li>Established a demilitarized zone (DMZ) along the 17th parallel separating the two Vietnams.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temporary Division of Vietnam:</strong> While intended to be temporary, the division solidified and led to the escalating conflict and eventual Vietnam War.</li>
<li><strong>US Involvement:</strong> The US, fearing communist expansion, refused to sign the Accords and began supporting the South Vietnamese government, setting the stage for direct American intervention.</li>
<li><strong>Failure of Reunification Elections:</strong> The scheduled 1956 elections were never held, largely due to South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem&rsquo;s (with US backing) concerns about a communist victory. This deepened the divide and fueled further conflict.</li>
<li><strong>Escalation of <a href="./../cold-war/">Cold War</a> Tensions:</strong> The <a href="./../geneva-accords/">Geneva Accords</a> and their aftermath became a major flashpoint in the Cold War, with the US and the Soviet Union backing opposing sides.</li>
<li><strong>Laos and Cambodia:</strong> While aimed at guaranteeing their neutrality, Laos and Cambodia were also drawn into the regional conflict, experiencing civil wars and becoming battlegrounds in the larger struggle.</li>
</ul>
