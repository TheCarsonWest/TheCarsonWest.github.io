<p>When we want to make a claim or decision about the true proportion of a certain characteristic within a population, we often use a Hypothesis Test. This process allows us to assess the evidence against a null hypothesis in favor of an alternative hypothesis. This note page focuses on the crucial initial steps of setting up such a test for a population proportion.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-four-step-process-introduction">The Four-Step Process (Introduction)</h2>
<p>A hypothesis test generally follows a four-step process, often remembered by mnemonics like &ldquo;PHANTOMS&rdquo; or &ldquo;PANDA&rdquo; (though specific steps vary slightly). The setup involves the first three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>P</strong>arameters: Define the population parameter of interest.</li>
<li><strong>H</strong>ypotheses: State the null and alternative hypotheses.</li>
<li><strong>A</strong>ssumptions/Conditions: Check the conditions required for the test.</li>
<li><strong>N</strong>ame the test and <strong>T</strong>est statistic: Identify the appropriate test and calculate its statistic (covered in Carrying Out a Test for a Population Proportion).</li>
<li><strong>O</strong>btain p-value: Determine the probability of observing our data (or more extreme) if the null hypothesis were true (covered in Interpreting p-Values).</li>
<li><strong>M</strong>ake a decision and <strong>S</strong>tate a conclusion: Compare the p-value to the significance level and draw a conclusion in context (covered in Concluding a Test for a Population Proportion).</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-defining-the-parameter-p">1. Defining the Parameter (P)</h2>
<p>First, clearly define the population parameter you are interested in. For a test about a population proportion, this is usually denoted by  $ p $ .</p>
<ul>
<li>Let  $ p $  = the true proportion of [contextual event/group] in the [defined population].</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Let  $ p $  = the true proportion of U.S. adults who support a new healthcare policy.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-stating-hypotheses-h">2. Stating Hypotheses (H)</h2>
<p>This is a critical step where you articulate the claim you are testing. Every hypothesis test involves two competing statements: the null hypothesis ( $ H_0 $ ) and the alternative hypothesis ( $ H_a $ ).</p>
<h3 id="null-hypothesis---h_0--">Null Hypothesis ( $ H_0 $ )</h3>
<p>The null hypothesis represents the status quo, a statement of no effect, no difference, or no change. It always includes an equality sign.</p>
<ul>
<li>$ H_0: p = p_0 $
*   where  $ p_0 $  is a specific hypothesized value for the population proportion.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alternative-hypothesis---h_a--">Alternative Hypothesis ( $ H_a $ )</h3>
<p>The alternative hypothesis is the statement we are trying to find evidence for. It reflects the claim or suspicion that something has changed or is different. It can be one-sided (greater than or less than) or two-sided (not equal to).</p>
<p><strong>Types of Alternative Hypotheses:</strong></p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th style="text-align: left">Type</th>
          <th style="text-align: left">Notation</th>
          <th style="text-align: left">Description</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: left"><strong>Two-Sided</strong></td>
          <td style="text-align: left">$ H_a: p \ne p_0 $</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">Used when we are interested in whether the true proportion is simply different from  $ p_0 $ .</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: left"><strong>One-Sided</strong></td>
          <td style="text-align: left">$ H_a: p &gt; p_0 $</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">Used when we are interested in whether the true proportion is greater than  $ p_0 $ .</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: left"><strong>One-Sided</strong></td>
          <td style="text-align: left">$ H_a: p &lt; p_0 $</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">Used when we are interested in whether the true proportion is less than  $ p_0 $ .</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Choosing the Alternative:</strong> The choice of  $ H_a $  depends on the specific question being asked or the claim being investigated.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A company claims that 80% of its customers are satisfied. A consumer group suspects this percentage is lower.
<ul>
<li>$ H_0: p = 0.80 $</li>
<li>$ H_a: p &lt; 0.80 $</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-checking-conditions-a">3. Checking Conditions (A)</h2>
<p>Before performing a hypothesis test for a population proportion, three key conditions must be met to ensure the sampling distribution of the sample proportion ( $ \hat{p} $ ) is approximately normal. These are often referred to as the &ldquo;Random, Normal, Independent&rdquo; conditions. This builds upon concepts from Sampling Distributions for Sample Proportions.</p>
<h3 id="a-random-condition">a. Random Condition</h3>
<p>The data must come from a Random Sampling and a Collection or a Randomized Experiment. This ensures the sample is representative of the population.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check:</strong> Was the sample obtained using a simple random sample (SRS) or a well-designed random process? If it&rsquo;s an experiment, were subjects randomly assigned?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-normal-condition-large-counts-condition">b. Normal Condition (Large Counts Condition)</h3>
<p>The sampling distribution of  $ \hat{p} $  is approximately normal if the expected number of successes and failures are both at least 10. Crucially, we use the hypothesized population proportion ( $ p_0 $ ) from  $ H_0 $  for this check, not the sample proportion ( $ \hat{p} $ ).</p>
<ul>
<li>$ np_0 \ge 10 $</li>
<li>$ n(1 - p_0) \ge 10 $</li>
</ul>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ n $  = sample size</li>
<li>$ p_0 $  = hypothesized population proportion from  $ H_0 $</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-independent-condition-10-condition">c. Independent Condition (10% Condition)</h3>
<p>When sampling without replacement, the observations must be independent. This is ensured if the sample size is no more than 10% of the population size.</p>
<ul>
<li>$ n \le 0.10N $
*   Where  $ N $  = population size.</li>
<li><strong>Check:</strong> Is the sample size ( $ n $ ) less than 10% of the total population size? If we assume the population is very large relative to the sample (e.g., millions of people), this condition is usually met.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Once these three steps are completed, you have successfully set up your hypothesis test for a population proportion and are ready to proceed with calculating the test statistic and p-value.</p>
