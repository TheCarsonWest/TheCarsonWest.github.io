<h2 id="when-may-4-1916">When: May 4, 1916</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Germany:</strong>  German government</li>
<li><strong>United States:</strong>  President Woodrow Wilson</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A promise made by the German government to the United States that German U-boats would not sink merchant ships without warning.  This followed the sinking of the British passenger liner, the Sussex, by a German U-boat, which resulted in American casualties.  The pledge included a commitment to only attack enemy merchant vessels that attempted to flee or resist.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Averted War (Temporarily):</strong> The Sussex Pledge temporarily eased tensions between the United States and Germany, averting immediate war.  It bought Wilson time to pursue his policy of neutrality.</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrated German Reluctance:</strong> While the pledge was seen as a diplomatic victory for the US, it also demonstrated Germany&rsquo;s reluctance to fully abandon unrestricted submarine warfare, a policy that would later be resumed, ultimately pushing the US into World War I.</li>
<li><strong>Short-lived Agreement:</strong> The pledge proved to be short-lived.  Germany, under pressure from its military leadership, eventually resumed unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917, leading to the Zimmerman Telegram incident and ultimately the declaration of war by the United States against Germany.</li>
<li><strong>Public Opinion:</strong> While the Pledge initially appeased many Americans, growing anti-German sentiment continued to increase as a result of continued German aggression.</li>
