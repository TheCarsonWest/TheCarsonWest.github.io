<p>This notes page details the &ldquo;Do&rdquo; step of a hypothesis test for the difference between two population means ( $ \mu_1 - \mu_2 $ ). This is where the test statistic is calculated and the p-value is determined, assuming the null hypothesis is true. Before proceeding, ensure you have properly <a href="./../setting-up-a-test-for-the-difference-of-two-population-means/">Setting Up a Test for the Difference of Two Population Means</a>.</p>
<h2 id="1-state-hypotheses">1. State Hypotheses</h2>
<p>Recall that the hypotheses for this test are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Null Hypothesis ( $ H_0 $ )</strong>: There is no difference between the two population means.
$$ H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0 \quad \text{ or } \quad \mu_1 = \mu_2 $$  *   <strong>Alternative Hypothesis ( $ H_a $ )</strong>: There is a difference between the two population means (directional or non-directional).
$$ H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 &gt; 0 \quad \text{ or } \quad \mu_1 &gt; \mu_2 \quad \text{ (right-tailed)} $$       $$ H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 &lt; 0 \quad \text{ or } \quad \mu_1 &lt; \mu_2 \quad \text{ (left-tailed)} $$       $$ H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq 0 \quad \text{ or } \quad \mu_1 \neq \mu_2 \quad \text{ (two-tailed)} $$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-check-conditions-plan">2. Check Conditions (PLAN)</h2>
<p>Before calculating the test statistic, verify that the conditions for inference are met. These are crucial for the validity of the results.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Random</strong>: The data come from two independent random samples or two groups in a randomized experiment. Without random sampling, generalizability to the population is compromised. Without random assignment in an experiment, a cause-and-effect conclusion cannot be drawn.</li>
<li><strong>Independent</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Within groups</strong>: Individual observations within each sample/group must be independent.</li>
<li><strong>Between groups</strong>: The two samples/groups must be independent of each other. This means knowing something about one group&rsquo;s values doesn&rsquo;t give information about the other.</li>
<li><strong>10% Condition</strong>: If sampling without replacement, ensure the sample sizes  $ n_1 $  and  $ n_2 $  are less than 10% of their respective population sizes ( $ N_1 $  and  $ N_2 $ ). That is,  $ n_1 \le 0.10 N_1 $  and  $ n_2 \le 0.10 N_2 $ . This ensures that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is not significantly underestimated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Normal / Large Sample</strong>: The sampling distribution of  $ \bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 $  must be approximately normal. This can be satisfied if:
<ul>
<li>Both population distributions are approximately normal (checked with graphs of sample data like dot plots, histograms, or normal probability plots showing no strong skewness or outliers).</li>
<li>Both sample sizes are sufficiently large ( $ n_1 \ge 30 $  and  $ n_2 \ge 30 $ ) due to <a href="./../the-central-limit-theorem/">The Central Limit Theorem</a>.</li>
<li>If one or both sample sizes are small, but the population distribution is clearly not normal, then a t-test is not appropriate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-calculate-the-test-statistic">3. Calculate the Test Statistic</h2>
<p>If the conditions are met, calculate the two-sample t-statistic:</p>
<p>$$ t = \frac{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}} $$<br>
Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ \bar{x}_1 $  and  $ \bar{x}_2 $  are the sample means.</li>
<li>$ \mu_1 $  and  $ \mu_2 $  are the hypothesized population means (under  $ H_0 $ ,  $ \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0 $ ).</li>
<li>$ s_1 $  and  $ s_2 $  are the sample standard deviations.</li>
<li>$ n_1 $  and  $ n_2 $  are the sample sizes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Degrees of Freedom (df)</strong>:
The degrees of freedom for this t-statistic are calculated using a complex formula (Welch-Satterthwaite equation), which typically results in a non-integer value. This is usually provided by statistical software or a calculator. For manual calculation or approximation, you can use the smaller of  $ n_1 - 1 $  and  $ n_2 - 1 $ . However, for AP Statistics, it&rsquo;s generally expected to use technology for the precise df.</p>
<h2 id="4-determine-the-p-value">4. Determine the p-value</h2>
<p>The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated, assuming the null hypothesis is true.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technology</strong>: Use a graphing calculator or statistical software to find the p-value.</li>
<li><strong>t-distribution table</strong>: If using an approximate df (the smaller of  $ n_1 - 1 $  and  $ n_2 - 1 $ ), you can use a t-distribution table to find a range for the p-value.</li>
</ul>
<p>The p-value depends on the alternative hypothesis:</p>
<ul>
<li>** $ H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 &gt; 0 $  (right-tailed)**:  $ p\text{-value} = P(T \ge t) $</li>
<li>** $ H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 &lt; 0 $  (left-tailed)**:  $ p\text{-value} = P(T \le t) $</li>
<li>** $ H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq 0 $  (two-tailed)**:  $ p\text{-value} = 2 \times P(T \ge |t|) $</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="./../interpreting-p-values/">Interpreting p-Values</a> is a critical skill for the conclusion.</p>
<h2 id="5-formulate-a-conclusion">5. Formulate a Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finally, compare your p-value to the chosen significance level ( $ \alpha $ , often 0.05).</p>
<ul>
<li>**If p-value &lt;  $ \alpha $ **: Reject the null hypothesis. There is convincing evidence that the true difference in population means is what the alternative hypothesis suggests.</li>
<li>**If p-value  $ \ge \alpha $ **: Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not convincing evidence that the true difference in population means is what the alternative hypothesis suggests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always state your conclusion in the context of the problem, referring back to the specific populations and variables involved. Be mindful of <a href="./../potential-errors-when-performing-tests/">Potential Errors When Performing Tests</a>. This process is similar to <a href="./../carrying-out-a-test-for-a-population-mean/">Carrying Out a Test for a Population Mean</a> but extended to two independent samples.</p>
