<h2 id="when--1857">When:  1857</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dred Scott, an enslaved man</li>
<li>John Sanford, Scott&rsquo;s owner</li>
<li>The Supreme Court of the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> (Chief Justice Roger Taney)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A landmark Supreme Court case in which Dred Scott, an enslaved man who had lived in free states and territories, sued for his freedom. The court ruled against Scott, declaring that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blacks, whether free or enslaved, were not considered citizens and therefore had no right to sue in federal court.</li>
<li>The <a href="./../missouri-compromise/">Missouri Compromise</a> was unconstitutional, meaning Congress could not prohibit slavery in the territories.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?</h2>
<p>The Dred Scott decision had a profound impact on the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>, significantly escalating tensions between North and South.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reinforced the idea of racial inequality</strong> by denying citizenship to African Americans.</li>
<li><strong>Fueled the Abolitionist movement</strong> and intensified calls for the end of slavery.</li>
<li><strong>Furthered the divide between North and South</strong>, as Northerners saw the decision as a victory for slavery, while Southerners viewed it as a validation of their rights.</li>
<li><strong>Contributed to the outbreak of the <a href="./../civil-war/">Civil War</a></strong> as it essentially declared that the federal government could not restrict the expansion of slavery.</li>
