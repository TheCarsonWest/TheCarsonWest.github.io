<h2 id="when-may-20-1882">When: May 20, 1882</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Germany:</strong> Otto von Bismarck (Chancellor)</li>
<li><strong>Austria-Hungary:</strong>  Emperor Franz Joseph I</li>
<li><strong>Italy:</strong>  King Umberto I</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A military alliance formed between Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy.  The agreement obligated each member to support the others militarily if attacked by another power.  This was a defensive alliance, meant to deter potential aggressors.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>European Power Balance:</strong> The Triple Alliance significantly altered the balance of power in Europe, creating a major bloc that countered the growing influence of other nations (like France and Russia).  It contributed to a climate of increased tension and suspicion among European powers.</li>
<li><strong>World War I Precursor:</strong> The alliance system, including the Triple Alliance, is often cited as a significant factor in the outbreak of World War I.  The complex web of alliances meant that a conflict between two nations could easily escalate into a much larger war.  Specifically, Austria-Hungaryâ€™s declaration of war on Serbia in 1914 triggered the alliance system, pulling in Germany (and thus Italy initially, though they eventually switched sides) and other nations.</li>
<li><strong>Italian Ambivalence:</strong> Italy&rsquo;s membership in the Triple Alliance was somewhat tenuous.  Italy&rsquo;s participation in the Triple Alliance was more opportunistic than driven by genuine ideological alignment. Their later switch to the Allied side in WWI demonstrates this.</li>
<li><strong>Shifting Alliances:</strong> The Triple Alliance demonstrated the ever-changing nature of international relations and the importance of military alliances in shaping foreign policy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</li>
