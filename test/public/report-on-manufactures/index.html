<h2 id="id-report-on-manufactures">ID: Report on Manufactures</h2>
<h2 id="when-december-5-1791">When: December 5, 1791</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authored by:</strong> <a href="./../alexander-hamilton/">Alexander Hamilton</a>, the first Secretary of the Treasury</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A proposal made by Hamilton to Congress outlining a plan for government-assisted economic development focused on promoting manufacturing in the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>.</p>
<p>Key recommendations included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protective tariffs:</strong>  To shield young American industries from foreign competition.</li>
<li><strong>Government subsidies:</strong>  Financial assistance for new industries.</li>
<li><strong>Investment in infrastructure:</strong>  Improvements to transportation, like roads and canals, to facilitate trade and resource movement.</li>
<li><strong>Promotion of innovation:</strong>  Support for inventions and technological advancements.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact? Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Laid the groundwork for <a href="./../the-american-system/">The American System</a>:</strong>  Though not fully implemented at the time, the ideas within the report heavily influenced later economic policies, particularly Henry Clay&rsquo;s &ldquo;American System&rdquo; in the early 19th century.</li>
<li><strong>Sparked debate about the role of government in the economy:</strong> The Report on Manufactures ignited a fierce debate between Federalists (like Hamilton), who favored a strong, interventionist government in economic affairs, and Democratic-Republicans (like <a href="./../thomas-jefferson/">Thomas Jefferson</a>), who preferred a more laissez-faire approach.</li>
<li><strong>Contributed to the rise of industrialization:</strong> While not immediately transformative, the report&rsquo;s ideas laid the foundation for the eventual growth of American manufacturing and contributed to the nation&rsquo;s shift from an agrarian to an industrial economy.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term impact:</strong> The debate over tariffs, government support for industry, and infrastructure development continues to resonate in American political and economic discourse today.</li>
