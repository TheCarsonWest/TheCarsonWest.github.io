<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Germany:</strong>  The Imperial German Navy, specifically its U-boat fleet.</li>
<li><strong>United States:</strong>  President Woodrow Wilson and the American people (indirectly involved as victims).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>Germany&rsquo;s policy of unrestricted submarine warfare during World War I involved attacking any and all ships, including neutral vessels, in the waters around Great Britain.  This was a departure from earlier, more restricted forms of submarine warfare.  The goal was to cut off supplies to Britain and force it to surrender.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lusitania Sinking (May 7, 1915):</strong> The sinking of the British passenger liner Lusitania, which carried American citizens, galvanized American public opinion against Germany. While not the sole cause, it greatly intensified anti-German sentiment.</li>
<li><strong>Zimmermann Telegram (1917):</strong> Intercepted by the British, this telegram revealed a German proposal to Mexico to ally against the U.S., further fueling American anger and pushing the U.S. closer to war.</li>
<li><strong>Declaration of War (April 6, 1917):</strong>  Germany&rsquo;s resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in early 1917, after initially suspending it in response to American protests, proved to be the final straw.  It led directly to President Wilson&rsquo;s request for a declaration of war against Germany, bringing the United States into World War I.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in War&rsquo;s Balance:</strong>  The entry of the United States dramatically altered the balance of power in favor of the Allies, providing vital manpower, resources, and financial support.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Consequences:</strong>  The war and its aftermath profoundly affected American foreign policy, leading to increased involvement in international affairs and shaping the nation&rsquo;s role in the 20th century.</li>
