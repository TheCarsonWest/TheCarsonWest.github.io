<ul>
<li><strong>Confederate:</strong> General Robert E. Lee and the Confederate Army of Northern <a href="./../virginia/">Virginia</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>Lee&rsquo;s Resolution refers to a series of decisions made by General Robert E. Lee in late 1864 and early 1865 following devastating Confederate losses.  Faced with Sherman&rsquo;s successful march through <a href="./../georgia/">Georgia</a> and the Union&rsquo;s victory at the Battle of Nashville, Lee recognized the increasingly dire situation of the Confederacy.  His &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; involved a shift in strategy, focusing on defensive maneuvers and attempting to prolong the war as long as possible to potentially secure favorable peace terms. This included concentrating his forces for defense and prioritizing the preservation of his army rather than large-scale offensives.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shift in Confederate Strategy:</strong>  Marked a transition from offensive to defensive warfare for the Confederacy, acknowledging the near impossibility of achieving military victory.</li>
<li><strong>Prolonging the War:</strong> Lee&rsquo;s actions aimed to prolong the conflict, hoping to exhaust Union resources and potentially negotiate a more advantageous peace settlement.</li>
<li><strong>Ultimately Unsuccessful:</strong> Despite his efforts, the Confederacy&rsquo;s military position remained hopeless. Lee&rsquo;s defensive strategies could not overcome the Union&rsquo;s superior manpower and resources.</li>
<li><strong>Precursor to Appomattox:</strong> Lee&rsquo;s resolution ultimately led to the final Confederate defeat at Appomattox Court House. It highlights the Confederate leadership&rsquo;s struggle to maintain hope amidst overwhelming military setbacks.</li>
<li><strong>Symbolic of Confederate Despair:</strong>  Demonstrates the growing desperation and recognition of inevitable defeat within the Confederate high command.</li>
