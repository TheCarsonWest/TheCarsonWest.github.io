<h2 id="introduction-to-mutually-exclusive-events">Introduction to Mutually Exclusive Events</h2>
<p>In [[Introduction to Probability]], we learned about events and their probabilities. Mutually exclusive events, also known as disjoint events, are a fundamental concept in probability theory. Two events are considered mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time. This means that if one event happens, the other simply cannot.</p>
<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>
<p>Two events,  $ A $  and  $ B $ , are <strong>mutually exclusive</strong> (or <strong>disjoint</strong>) if they have no outcomes in common. That is, the occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of the other.</p>
<h2 id="key-characteristics">Key Characteristics</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Overlap</strong>: Mutually exclusive events never share any common outcomes in the sample space.</li>
<li><strong>Simultaneous Occurrence Impossible</strong>: It is impossible for both events to happen at the same time in a single trial or observation.</li>
<li><strong>Intersection is Empty</strong>: The intersection of two mutually exclusive events is an empty set ( $ \emptyset $ ).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="visualizing-mutually-exclusive-events">Visualizing Mutually Exclusive Events</h3>
<p>Venn diagrams are excellent tools for visualizing relationships between events. For mutually exclusive events, their circles in a Venn diagram will not overlap.</p>

</code></pre><p>In this diagram, the circles representing Event A and Event B are separate, indicating no common outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="probability-of-mutually-exclusive-events">Probability of Mutually Exclusive Events</h2>
<p>When two events  $ A $  and  $ B $  are mutually exclusive, the probability that both events occur is 0. This is expressed as:</p>
<p>$$ P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A \cap B) = 0 $$</p>
<h3 id="the-addition-rule-for-mutually-exclusive-events">The Addition Rule for Mutually Exclusive Events</h3>
<p>For any two events  $ A $  and  $ B $ , the general addition rule for the probability of their union (the probability that  $ A $  occurs or  $ B $  occurs or both occur) is:</p>
<p>$$ P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) $$<br>
However, if  $ A $  and  $ B $  are mutually exclusive, we know that  $ P(A \cap B) = 0 $ . Therefore, the addition rule simplifies considerably for mutually exclusive events:</p>
<p>$$ P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) $$<br>
This simplified rule states that the probability of one or the other mutually exclusive event occurring is simply the sum of their individual probabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
Consider rolling a standard six-sided die.
Let event  $ A $  be rolling an even number {2, 4, 6}.  $ P(A) = 3/6 = 1/2 $ .
Let event  $ B $  be rolling an odd number {1, 3, 5}.  $ P(B) = 3/6 = 1/2 $ .</p>
<p>Are  $ A $  and  $ B $  mutually exclusive? Yes, you cannot roll a number that is both even and odd simultaneously. The intersection  $ A \cap B = \emptyset $ .
The probability of rolling an even OR an odd number is:
$ P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 $ . This makes sense, as all outcomes are either even or odd.</p>
<h2 id="mutually-exclusive-vs-independent-events">[[Mutually Exclusive vs. Independent Events]]</h2>
<p>It is crucial to understand the difference between mutually exclusive events and [[Independent Events and Unions of Events]]. These two concepts are often confused but are almost opposite of each other.</p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaway</strong>: If two events are mutually exclusive and have non-zero probabilities, they cannot be independent. If  $ P(A) &gt; 0 $  and  $ P(B) &gt; 0 $ , and they are mutually exclusive, then  $ P(A \cap B) = 0 $ . However, if they were independent,  $ P(A \cap B) $  would be  $ P(A) \cdot P(B) $ , which would be greater than 0. Since  $ 0 \ne P(A) \cdot P(B) $  (unless one event has a probability of 0), they cannot be both.</p>
<p>The only case where two events can be both mutually exclusive and independent is if at least one of them is an impossible event (i.e., has a probability of 0). This is usually not relevant for typical AP Statistics problems.</p>

<li><strong>Card Deck</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Event  $ A $ : Drawing a red card.</li>
<li>Event  $ B $ : Drawing a black card.</li>
<li>Are  $ A $  and  $ B $  mutually exclusive? Yes, a card cannot be both red and black.  $ P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) = 26/52 + 26/52 = 1 $ .</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Survey Data</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Event  $ C $ : A randomly selected person is a high school student.</li>
<li>Event  $ D $ : A randomly selected person is a college graduate.</li>
<li>Are  $ C $  and  $ D $  mutually exclusive? Yes, assuming a person cannot be both at the same time for the purpose of the survey (e.g., they are not simultaneously enrolled in both).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding mutually exclusive events is fundamental for correctly applying the addition rule and for distinguishing between different types of event relationships in probability calculations.</p>
