<h2 id="when-june-28-1919-signed">When: June 28, 1919 (Signed)</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./../allied-powers/">Allied Powers</a>:</strong> Primarily <a href="./../france/">France</a> (Georges Clemenceau), Britain (David Lloyd George), and the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> (<a href="./../woodrow-wilson/">Woodrow Wilson</a>)</li>
<li><strong><a href="./../central-powers/">Central Powers</a>:</strong> Primarily Germany (forced to accept the terms)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A peace treaty signed at the end of World War I.  It imposed harsh penalties on Germany, including territorial losses, demilitarization, and significant reparations payments.  It also created the <a href="./../league-of-nations/">League of Nations</a>, an international organization intended to prevent future wars.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>German Resentment:</strong>  The treaty created deep resentment in Germany due to the perceived unfairness and severity of the terms, which contributed to the rise of extremist ideologies like <a href="./../nazism/">Nazism</a> in the 1930s.</li>
<li><strong><a href="./../league-of-nations/">League of Nations</a>:</strong> The creation of the <a href="./../league-of-nations/">League of Nations</a> was intended to foster international cooperation and prevent future wars, but the US Senate refused to ratify the Treaty and join the League, weakening its effectiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Seeds of WWII:</strong> Many historians argue that the <a href="./../treaty-of-versailles/">Treaty of Versailles</a>, with its punitive measures against Germany, contributed significantly to the conditions that led to World War II.</li>
<li><strong>US Isolationism:</strong> The US Senate&rsquo;s rejection of the treaty reflected a desire for isolationism and a reluctance to become entangled in European affairs.</li>
<li><strong>New Nations:</strong> The treaty led to the creation of new nations and redefined borders in Europe based on self-determination, though these changes were often fraught with ethnic and political tensions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="id-league-of-nationsleague-of-nations">ID: <a href="./../league-of-nations/">League of Nations</a></h2>
<h2 id="when-established-january-10-1920">When: Established January 10, 1920</h2>
<h2 id="who-1">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proposed by:</strong> <a href="./../woodrow-wilson/">Woodrow Wilson</a></li>
<li><strong>Key Members (Initially):</strong> <a href="./../great-britain/">Great Britain</a>, <a href="./../france/">France</a>, Italy, Japan (US never joined)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-1">What:</h2>
<p>An international organization formed after World War I to promote peace and cooperation among nations. It aimed to prevent future wars through diplomacy, arbitration, and collective security.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant-1">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Absence:</strong> The <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>&rsquo; failure to join significantly weakened the League&rsquo;s power and credibility. Isolationist sentiment in the US Senate prevented ratification of the <a href="./../treaty-of-versailles/">Treaty of Versailles</a> and US membership.</li>
<li><strong>Weakness in Preventing Aggression:</strong>  The League proved largely ineffective in preventing aggression in the 1930s, such as Japan&rsquo;s invasion of Manchuria and Italy&rsquo;s invasion of Ethiopia.</li>
<li><strong>Precursor to the UN:</strong> Served as a model for the United Nations after World War II, incorporating lessons learned from the League&rsquo;s failures.</li>
<li><strong>International Cooperation:</strong> While ultimately unsuccessful in its primary goal, the League did foster some international cooperation on issues like health, labor standards, and refugee assistance.</li>
<li><strong>Idealistic Goal:</strong>  The League represented an idealistic attempt to create a system of collective security, reflecting the widespread desire to avoid another global conflict.</li>
