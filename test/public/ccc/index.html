<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>President Franklin D. Roosevelt:</strong> Championed the CCC as part of his New Deal program.</li>
<li><strong>Unemployed young men:</strong> Primarily targeted young men aged 18-25 (later expanded to include those 17-28) from families on relief.</li>

<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was a public work relief program that operated from 1933 to 1942 in the United States for unemployed, unmarried men. It provided them with manual labor jobs related to the conservation and development of natural resources in rural lands owned by federal, state, and local governments. Projects included planting trees, building parks, fighting soil erosion, and improving wildlife habitats. Enrollees lived in camps managed by the U.S. Army and were paid a small monthly wage, a portion of which was sent home to their families.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Relief:</strong> Provided employment and income to millions of unemployed young men during the Great Depression, helping to alleviate poverty and hardship.</li>
<li><strong>Conservation of Natural Resources:</strong> Made significant contributions to the conservation and development of natural resources, including planting billions of trees, creating parks, and preventing soil erosion. These efforts helped to preserve the environment for future generations.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure Development:</strong> Built roads, bridges, trails, and other infrastructure in rural areas, improving access to these areas and supporting economic development.</li>
<li><strong>Skill Development:</strong> Provided enrollees with valuable job skills and training, improving their long-term employment prospects.</li>
<li><strong>Social Impact:</strong> Helped to improve the health and well-being of enrollees by providing them with food, shelter, and medical care. It also fostered a sense of national unity and purpose during a time of crisis.</li>
<li><strong>Lasting Legacy:</strong> Many of the parks, forests, and other natural resources developed by the CCC continue to be enjoyed by Americans today. The CCC is considered one of the most successful and popular New Deal programs.</li>
<li><strong>Ended Due to WWII:</strong> The program ended in 1942 due to the need for manpower and resources for World War II.</li>
