<h2 id="intermediate-value-theorem-ivt">[[Intermediate Value Theorem]] (IVT)</h2>
<p>The [[Intermediate Value Theorem]] (IVT) is a fundamental theorem in calculus that helps us understand the behavior of continuous functions. It essentially states that if a continuous function takes on two values, then it must also take on all the values in between.</p>
<h1 id="statement-of-the-ivt">Statement of the IVT</h1>
<p>Let  $ f $  be a continuous function on the closed interval  $ [a,b] $ . If  $ f(a) \neq f(b) $ , then for any value  $ k $  between  $ f(a) $  and  $ f(b) $ , there exists a value  $ c $  in the interval  $ (a,b) $  such that  $ f(c) = k $ .</p>
<h3 id="visualizing-the-ivt">Visualizing the IVT</h3>
<p>Imagine a continuous curve representing the function  $ f(x) $  on the interval  $ [a,b] $ .  The IVT says that if the curve starts at a point with a certain y-value and ends at a point with a different y-value, then it must pass through every y-value in between those two points.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Consider the function  $ f(x) = x^[[2]] $  on the interval  $ [0,[[2]]] $ .   $ f(0) = 0 $  and  $ f([[2]]) = [[4]] $ .  Since  $ f(x) $  is continuous, the IVT tells us that for any value  $ k $  between 0 and [[4]], there exists a value  $ c $  in the interval  $ (0,[[2]]) $  such that  $ f(c) = k $ .</p>

<h3 id="key-points">Key Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>[[Continuity]] is crucial:</strong> The IVT only applies to continuous functions. If a function has a jump, hole, or vertical asymptote within the interval, the theorem may not hold.</li>
<li><strong>Closed interval:</strong> The IVT requires the interval to be closed, meaning it includes both endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Intermediate value:</strong> The theorem guarantees the existence of a value  $ c $  where  $ f(c) = k $ , but it doesn&rsquo;t tell us how to find that value.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="applications-of-the-ivt">Applications of the IVT</h3>
<p>The IVT has numerous applications in calculus and other areas of mathematics. Some common uses include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finding roots:</strong> The IVT can be used to prove that a function has a root (a value where the function equals zero) within a given interval.</li>
<li><strong>Solving equations:</strong> The IVT can help us determine if an equation has a solution within a specific interval.</li>
<li><strong>Proving inequalities:</strong> The IVT can be used to prove inequalities by showing that a function takes on a specific value within an interval.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-proving-the-existence-of-a-root">Example: Proving the Existence of a Root</h3>
<p>Let  $ f(x) = x^[[3]] - 2x - [[5]] $ . We want to prove that  $ f(x) $  has a root in the interval  $ [[[2]],[[3]]] $ .</p>
<p>[[1]]. <strong>[[Continuity]]:</strong>   $ f(x) $  is a polynomial function, which is continuous everywhere.
[[2]]. <strong>Interval:</strong> We are considering the closed interval  $ [[[2]],[[3]]] $ .
[[3]]. <strong>Values at endpoints:</strong>   $ f([[2]]) = 8 - [[4]] - [[5]] = -[[1]] $  and  $ f([[3]]) = 27 - [[6]] - [[5]] = 16 $ .
[[4]]. <strong>Intermediate value:</strong> Since  $ f([[2]]) $  is negative and  $ f([[3]]) $  is positive, the IVT guarantees that there exists a value  $ c $  in the interval  $ ([[2]],[[3]]) $  such that  $ f(c) = 0 $ .</p>
<p>Therefore, we have proven that  $ f(x) = x^[[3]] - 2x - [[5]] $  has a root in the interval  $ [[[2]],[[3]]] $ .</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The IVT only proves the existence of a root, not its exact value. To find the root, we would need to use numerical methods like the Bisection Method.</p>
