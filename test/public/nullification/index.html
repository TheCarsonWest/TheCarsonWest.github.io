<h2 id="when-1798-1833">When: 1798-1833</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>[[James Madison]]:</strong> Authored the [[Virginia]] Resolutions in 1798, outlining the concept of nullification.</li>
<li><strong>[[Thomas Jefferson]]:</strong> Authored the [[Kentucky]] Resolutions in 1798, echoing Madison&rsquo;s sentiments.</li>
<li><strong>John C. Calhoun:</strong>  Prominent advocate of nullification, serving as Vice-President under [[John Quincy Adams]] and [[Andrew Jackson]].  He argued for nullification in the 1830s, particularly in response to the [[Tariff of Abominations]].</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what--nullification-was-a-controversial-political-doctrine-that-asserted-the-right-of-individual-states-to-declare-federal-laws-null-and-void-within-their-borders-if-they-deemed-them-unconstitutional--it-was-rooted-in-the-idea-of-states-rights-and-the-belief-that-the-federal-government-was-a-creation-of-the-states-not-the-other-way-around">What:  [[Nullification]] was a controversial political doctrine that asserted the right of individual states to declare federal laws null and void within their borders if they deemed them unconstitutional.  It was rooted in the idea of states&rsquo; rights and the belief that the federal government was a creation of the states, not the other way around.</h2>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heightened tensions between states and the federal government:</strong> [[Nullification]] exacerbated the debate over the balance of power between the national and state governments, a central issue in American history.</li>
<li><strong>Led to the [[Nullification]] Crisis of 1832-1833:</strong>  [[South Carolina]], under Calhoun&rsquo;s influence, threatened to secede from the Union after declaring the [[Tariff of Abominations]] null and void within the state.  President [[Andrew Jackson]] responded with a forceful declaration that nullification was unconstitutional and ultimately threatened to use military force to enforce the federal law.  While [[South Carolina]] eventually backed down, the crisis highlighted the growing [[sectionalism]] and divisions within the country.</li>
<li><strong>Influenced the debate over slavery:</strong> The principle of nullification was used by Southern states to defend their right to maintain slavery, arguing that the federal government could not interfere with their &ldquo;domestic institutions.&rdquo;  This led to an escalation of tensions between North and South, ultimately contributing to the outbreak of the [[Civil War]].</li>
<li><strong>Continued to be invoked in debates over federal power throughout American history:</strong>  The concept of nullification, while ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court, has continued to be invoked by proponents of states&rsquo; rights in various debates, such as those over gun control, environmental regulations, and immigration policy.</li>
