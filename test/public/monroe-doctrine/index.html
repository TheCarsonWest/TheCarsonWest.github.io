<h1 id="id-monroe-doctrine">ID: Monroe Doctrine</h1>
<h2 id="when-december-2-1823">When: December 2, 1823</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>President <a href="./../james-monroe/">James Monroe</a></strong> (The doctrine was written by Secretary of State <a href="./../john-quincy-adams/">John Quincy Adams</a>, but it was part of Monroe&rsquo;s annual message to Congress)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A foreign policy statement declaring that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Americas were closed to further European colonization.</strong>  Any attempts to colonize or interfere in the Western Hemisphere by European powers would be considered a hostile act against the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>.</li>
<li><strong>The <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> would not interfere in the internal affairs of European nations</strong> or their existing colonies.</li>
<li><strong>The <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> recognized and would not interfere with existing colonies in the Western Hemisphere.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact? Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Established the U.S. as a dominant power in the Western Hemisphere.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Asserted American neutrality in European conflicts,</strong> signaling a departure from its previous involvement in European affairs.</li>
<li><strong>Laid the groundwork for future U.S. interventionism in Latin America.</strong> While initially about protecting the Americas from Europe, the Monroe Doctrine would later be used to justify U.S. interventions in Latin American countries.</li>
<li><strong>Had little impact at the time</strong> as the U.S. lacked the military strength to enforce it. Its significance grew later in the 19th century as the U.S. became a stronger nation.</li>
<li><strong>Remains a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy today</strong>, though its interpretation and application have evolved over time.</li>
