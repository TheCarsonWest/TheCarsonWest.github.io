<h2 id="when--late-1876-early-1877-specifically-the-presidential-election-of-1876-was-contested-and-the-final-outcome-was-decided-in-february-1877">When:  Late 1876-Early 1877 (Specifically, the Presidential Election of 1876 was contested and the final outcome was decided in February 1877)</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Samuel J. Tilden:</strong> Democratic Presidential Candidate</li>
<li><strong><a href="./../rutherford-b.-hayes/">Rutherford B. Hayes</a>:</strong> Republican Presidential Candidate</li>
<li><strong>The Electoral Commission:</strong> A bipartisan group created by Congress to settle the disputed election results.</li>
<li><strong>Southern <a href="./../democrats/">Democrats</a>:</strong>  They supported Tilden and made concessions in exchange for the withdrawal of federal troops from the South.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contested Election of 1876:</strong>  The Presidential election between Tilden and Hayes was extremely close.  Several states, particularly in the South, had conflicting election results, leading to disputes over who won.</li>
<li><strong>The Electoral Commission:</strong> Congress created this commission to settle the election dispute.  It was made up of five Representatives, five Senators, and five Supreme Court justices.</li>
<li><strong>Bargaining and Compromise:</strong> Southern <a href="./../democrats/">Democrats</a> ultimately agreed to support Hayes&rsquo; election in exchange for a number of concessions from Republicans, including the withdrawal of federal troops from the South, federal funding for Southern infrastructure, and the appointment of a Southerner to Hayes&rsquo; cabinet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact">Impact:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>End of Reconstruction:</strong> The Compromise of 1877 effectively ended Reconstruction in the South.  Federal protection of African American civil rights ceased, and white Southerners were able to regain political and economic power.</li>
<li><strong>Rise of Jim Crow:</strong>  With the end of Reconstruction, Southern states passed &ldquo;Jim Crow&rdquo; laws that severely limited African American rights and segregated society.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Development in the South:</strong>  The Compromise led to federal support for Southern infrastructure, which helped to boost the region&rsquo;s economy.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in Political Power:</strong> The compromise helped to solidify the Republican Party&rsquo;s control over the national government, but it also alienated African Americans and gave the South more political autonomy.</li>
