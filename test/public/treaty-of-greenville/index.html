<h2 id="when-august-3-1795">When: August [[3]], 1795</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>[[United States]]</strong> represented by General &ldquo;Mad&rdquo; Anthony Wayne</li>
<li><strong>Native American tribes</strong> of the Northwest Confederacy (including Miami, Shawnee, [[Delaware]], and others)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A treaty signed after the decisive American victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, ending the Northwest Indian War. In the treaty:</p>
<ul>
<li>Native American tribes ceded a significant portion of their lands in the Northwest Territory (modern-day [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], and parts of [[Michigan]]) to the [[United States]].</li>
<li>The treaty established an official boundary between Native American territory and lands open to white settlement.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact? Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opened the Northwest Territory to American settlement:</strong>  Led to a wave of white migration and settlement westward, fueling tensions and future conflicts over land.</li>
<li><strong>Formalized U.S. dominance in the region:</strong> Established American sovereignty over the Northwest Territory and solidified their claims to the land.</li>
<li><strong>Exacerbated tensions with [[Great Britain]]:</strong>  The British had supported the Native American tribes against the U.S. The treaty increased tensions that were already high due to disputes over trade and impressment.</li>
<li><strong>Temporary peace, but not a lasting solution:</strong> While it brought an end to immediate violence, the treaty did little to address the underlying issues of land rights and cultural differences, leading to further conflicts in the future.</li>
</ul>
