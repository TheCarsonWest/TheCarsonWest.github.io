<h2 id="when-1832">When: 1832</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Samuel Worcester:</strong> A missionary who lived with the Cherokee Nation and challenged Georgia&rsquo;s law that forced Cherokee removal.</li>
<li><strong>Georgia:</strong> State of Georgia, which passed laws to assert control over Cherokee land and forcibly remove them.</li>
<li><strong>John Marshall:</strong> Chief Justice of the Supreme Court who presided over the case.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court case in which the court ruled that Georgia had no authority to regulate the Cherokee Nation or their land, as they were considered a sovereign nation. The decision was a major victory for the Cherokee people, but Georgia ignored the ruling and continued to push for their removal.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengthened Cherokee rights:</strong> Although the ruling was ignored, it solidified the Cherokee Nation&rsquo;s legal right to self-government and control over their territory.</li>
<li><strong>Set a precedent for Native American rights:</strong> Worcester v. Georgia helped establish the principle of tribal sovereignty and the legal recognition of Native American nations.</li>
<li><strong>Contributed to the Trail of Tears:</strong>  Georgia&rsquo;s defiance of the court&rsquo;s ruling contributed to the forced removal of the Cherokee Nation from their lands, a traumatic event known as the Trail of Tears.</li>
<li><strong>Highlighting federal-state conflict:</strong> The case further revealed the tension between the federal government&rsquo;s authority over Native American affairs and the states&rsquo; desire to control land and resources.</li>
