<main>
<p>A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. The substance present in the largest amount is called the solvent, while the other substances are called solutes. Solutions can be classified as either aqueous or non-aqueous, depending on whether the solvent is water or not.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of Solutions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aqueous solutions:</strong> Salt water, sugar water, vinegar</li>
<li><strong>Non-aqueous solutions:</strong> Alcohol, gasoline, oil</li>
<li><a href="./../electrolyte/">Electrolyte</a>s can be dissolved in solutions to make unique properties</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concentration of Solutions</strong></p>
<p>The concentration of a solution is a measure of the amount of solute present in a given amount of solvent. There are several ways to express concentration, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./../molarity/">Molarity</a> (M):</strong> Moles of solute per liter of solution
$  $ \text{Molarity} = \frac{\text{Moles of solute}}{\text{Liters of solution}} $  $  * <strong>Molality (m):</strong> Moles of solute per kilogram of solvent
$  $ \text{Molality} = \frac{\text{Moles of solute}}{\text{Kilograms of solvent}} $  $  * <strong>Mass percent (% m/m):</strong> Grams of solute per 100 grams of solution
$  $ \text{Mass percent} = \frac{\text{Grams of solute}}{\text{Grams of solution}} \times 100% $  $  * <strong>Volume percent (% v/v):</strong> Milliliters of solute per 100 milliliters of solution
$  $ \text{Volume percent} = \frac{\text{Milliliters of solute}}{\text{Milliliters of solution}} \times 100% $  $<br>
<strong>Colligative Properties of Solutions</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Colligative properties are properties of solutions that depend only on the concentration of the solute, not on its identity. These properties include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vapor pressure lowering:</strong> The vapor pressure of a solution is lower than that of the pure solvent.</li>
<li><strong>Boiling point elevation:</strong> The boiling point of a solution is higher than that of the pure solvent.</li>
<li><strong>Freezing point depression:</strong> The freezing point of a solution is lower than that of the pure solvent.</li>
<li><strong>Osmotic pressure:</strong> The osmotic pressure of a solution is the pressure that must be applied to the solution to prevent water from flowing into it from a pure solvent.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chemical Reactions in Solutions</strong></p>
<p>Many chemical reactions occur in solutions. These reactions can be represented using chemical equations that include the concentrations of the reactants and products. For example, the following equation represents the reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in aqueous solution:</p>
<p>$  $ \text{HCl(aq)} + \text{NaOH(aq)} \rightarrow \text{NaCl(aq)} + \text{H}_2\text{O(l)} $  $<br>
The concentrations of the reactants and products can be used to calculate the equilibrium constant for the reaction, which is a measure of the extent to which the reaction proceeds.</p>
