<h2 id="who">WHO:</h2>
<p>Scott Joplin (most famous composer), other notable composers and performers including but not limited to: Jelly Roll Morton, Eubie Blake, James P. Johnson.  African American musicians were primarily responsible for creating and popularizing the genre.</p>
<h2 id="what">WHAT:</h2>
<p>Ragtime was a musical genre characterized by its syncopated rhythm,  a specific rhythmic pattern where accents are placed on normally unaccented beats. It often featured a strong, driving beat and melodies with a distinctive &ldquo;ragged&rdquo; or irregular quality. It was popular in sheet music and played on pianos in saloons, dance halls, and eventually concert halls.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">IMPACT: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bridging Musical Styles:</strong> Ragtime blended European musical traditions (classical influences) with African American musical traditions (rhythms and improvisation), foreshadowing the development of jazz.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural Impact:</strong> Ragtime was a significant form of musical expression for African Americans during a time of racial segregation, giving them a platform for artistic creation and cultural identity. It also reflected the social changes and energy of the era.</li>
<li><strong><a href="./../popular-culture/">Popular Culture</a>:</strong> It achieved widespread popularity across racial lines, demonstrating the power of music to transcend social boundaries (though racial segregation still greatly limited the opportunities for Black performers and composers).</li>
<li><strong>Influence on Later Genres:</strong> Its rhythmic innovations heavily influenced jazz, blues, and other popular music genres that followed. It helped pave the way for the evolution of American popular music in the 20th century.</li>
<li><strong>Technological influence:</strong> The rise of player pianos and sheet music aided in Ragtime&rsquo;s popularity and distribution.</li>
