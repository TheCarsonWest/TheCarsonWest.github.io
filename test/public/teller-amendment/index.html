<h2 id="id-teller-amendment">ID: Teller Amendment</h2>
<h2 id="when-april-20-1898">When: April 20, 1898</h2>
<h2 id="who--senator-henry-m-teller-introduced-the-amendment--us-congress-passed-the-amendment">Who:  Senator Henry M. Teller (introduced the amendment);  U.S. Congress (passed the amendment)</h2>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A joint resolution of the U.S. Congress, attached as an amendment to the war declaration against Spain.  The Teller Amendment declared that the United States had no intention of annexing Cuba after the Spanish-American War;  that once the war was won, Cuba would be granted its independence.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited U.S. Imperialist Aims (Initially):</strong>  The amendment aimed to reassure both the Cuban people and the American public that U.S. intervention was altruistic and aimed at liberating Cuba, not conquering it.  This helped garner support for the war.</li>
<li><strong>Moral Justification (Debated):</strong> While it served to limit stated intentions, the amendmentâ€™s sincerity was questioned later, given the U.S.&rsquo;s continued military presence and eventual influence in Cuba&rsquo;s affairs following the war.</li>
<li><strong>Precursor to Platt Amendment:</strong> The Teller Amendment&rsquo;s idealistic goal of Cuban independence was ultimately undermined by the later Platt Amendment (1901), which significantly restricted Cuba&rsquo;s sovereignty.</li>
<li><strong>Public Opinion &amp; War Support:</strong> The amendment played a role in swaying public opinion in favor of war by emphasizing the humanitarian aspects of the conflict.  It also helped to alleviate concerns about potential imperialistic designs.</li>
<li><strong>Shaping U.S. Foreign Policy:</strong> The Teller Amendment&rsquo;s legacy highlights the complexities of U.S. foreign policy, its tendency towards interventionism, and the frequent tension between idealistic pronouncements and pragmatic actions.</li>
