<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>:</strong> Admiral Chester Nimitz, Admiral Raymond Spruance, Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher</li>
<li><strong>Japan:</strong> Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, Admiral Chuichi Nagumo</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A crucial naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II, fought near the Midway Atoll. The U.S. Navy decisively defeated the Imperial Japanese Navy in a surprise attack. The US cracked the Japanese code and knew the details of their attack and where they were headed.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turning Point in the Pacific:</strong> Widely considered the turning point in the Pacific War. It shifted the strategic initiative from Japan to the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Crippled Japanese Navy:</strong> The Japanese lost four of their best aircraft carriers (Akagi, Kaga, Soryu, and Hiryu), along with numerous aircraft and experienced pilots, a loss they could not easily replace.</li>
<li><strong>Boosted U.S. Morale:</strong> The victory significantly boosted American morale after the attack on Pearl Harbor and other early Japanese successes.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Advantage:</strong> Allowed the U.S. to go on the offensive in the Pacific, launching campaigns to recapture islands held by Japan.</li>
<li><strong>Codebreaking Success:</strong> The U.S. Navy&rsquo;s success was largely due to its ability to decipher Japanese naval codes (specifically JN-25), which gave them advance knowledge of the Japanese plan of attack.</li>
