<p>E.G. Ravenstein, a 19th-century geographer, formulated a set of laws to describe migration patterns. These laws, known as Ravenstein&rsquo;s Laws of Migration, remain relevant today, providing a foundational understanding of human movement across space.</p>
<p>Key Laws:</p>
<h1 id="1-most-migrants-move-only-a-short-distance">1: Most migrants move only a short distance:</h1>
<ul>
<li>This distance decay principle suggests that migration decreases with increasing distance.  People are more likely to move to nearby locations due to familiar environments, lower transportation costs, and easier communication.</li>
<li>Its easier to move short distances than long distances, duh</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="2-migrants-who-move-longer-distances-tend-to-go-to-large-cities">2: Migrants who move longer distances tend to go to large cities:</h1>
<ul>
<li>This highlights the role of pull factors like economic opportunities and urban amenities in attracting migrants from further afield.</li>
<li>Why tf would you move across the world to farm corn bruh</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="3-migration-occurs-in-steps">3: Migration occurs in steps:</h1>
<ul>
<li>People often migrate in stages, moving first to a nearby town or city before venturing further. This is especially true for rural-to-urban migration and reflects a gradual process of adapting to new environments.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="4-each-migration-flow-produces-a-counter-migration">4: Each migration flow produces a counter-migration:</h1>
<ul>
<li>For every migration stream, there is an opposing flow. This highlights the push-pull factors that influence migration, with people moving in response to both positive and negative conditions in their origin and destination areas.</li>
<li>Kinda just a bs rule to cover our asses
<ul>
<li>Mexico to US: Mexicans want to go to estados unidos to escape el cartelo</li>
<li>US to Mexico: Retired Americans to to Mexico (really just Cancun) for the warm weather and cheap prices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Return Migration</strong>: People have had enough of the country they move to, and come back once
<ul>
<li>Lebanon -&gt; Turkey -&gt; Lebanon (-&gt; Turkey?)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Inzz0iKcB9c">Beirut Explosion</a> + Inflation + bank run, people leave the country</li>
<li>Things are stablilizing so people came back</li>
<li>Hezbollah decided to poke the lion&rsquo;s balls and now they are involved with the Hamas War, so everyone is back to being gone</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chain Migration
<ul>
<li>Outlier</li>
<li>When one person leaves, and then the whole squad comes over
<ul>
<li>Dad leaves for job</li>
<li>Mom comes back with the kids</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="5-most-migrants-are-young-adults">5: Most migrants are young adults:</h1>
<ul>
<li>This reflects the life cycle stage where individuals are most likely to be seeking employment, education, or family opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="6-males-are-more-likely-to-migrate-than-females">6: Males are more likely to migrate than females:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Men are more ambitious than women and are much more likely to take a big risk by moving</li>
<li>Indians moving to dubai to work in construction until they die creates the 3:1 male:female ratio</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="7-most-moves-are-economic">7: Most moves are economic</h1>
<ul>
<li>tryna get the bag</li>
<li>not much more to say</li>
</ul>
