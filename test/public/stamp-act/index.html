<h2 id="when-march-22-1765">When: March 22, 1765</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>[[Great Britain]]:</strong>  Parliament imposed the act.</li>
<li><strong>American Colonists:</strong> Primarily affected by the tax.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>An act passed by the British Parliament that imposed a direct tax on the American colonies.  It required colonists to purchase special stamped paper for various documents and publications, including newspapers, legal documents, and playing cards.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Colonial Resistance:</strong> The [[Stamp Act]] sparked widespread protests and boycotts throughout the American colonies.  Groups like the [[Sons of Liberty]] organized protests and demonstrations.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;No Taxation Without Representation&rdquo;:</strong> The act fueled the cry of &ldquo;No taxation without representation,&rdquo; highlighting the colonists&rsquo; anger at being taxed by a government in which they had no direct voice.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Tensions:</strong> The [[Stamp Act]] significantly escalated tensions between [[Great Britain]] and its American colonies, contributing to the growing divide that eventually led to the American Revolution.</li>
<li><strong>Repeal (1766):</strong> Due to the intense colonial resistance and economic disruption, the [[Stamp Act]] was repealed in 1766, though the Declaratory Act was passed simultaneously, asserting Parliament&rsquo;s right to tax the colonies.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Impact:</strong> The [[Stamp Act]]&rsquo;s legacy lies in its contribution to the development of colonial identity and the growing sentiment for independence from British rule.  It served as a key event in the chain of events leading up to the American Revolution.</li>
