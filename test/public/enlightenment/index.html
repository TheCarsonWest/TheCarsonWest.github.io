<h2 id="when-late-17th-century---late-18th-century-roughly-1680s-1780s">When: Late 17th Century - Late 18th Century (roughly 1680s-1780s)</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Thinkers:</strong> John Locke (influence paramount), Montesquieu, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau (whose ideas had less direct impact than Locke&rsquo;s but still influenced later revolutionary thought).</li>
<li><strong>American Adopters:</strong> [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], and many Founding Fathers.  The general population, particularly educated elites, were also influenced.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>The [[Enlightenment]], a philosophical movement emphasizing reason, individualism, and skepticism, profoundly impacted American thought and the development of the nation.  Key ideas included natural rights (life, liberty, property – Locke), separation of powers (Montesquieu), and the social contract (Rousseau). These concepts fueled revolutionary sentiment and shaped the political and social structures of the newly formed [[United States]].  The [[Great Awakening]] (1730s-1740s) – a religious revival – also contributed to a questioning of authority and a focus on individual faith which overlapped and interacted with [[Enlightenment]] thought.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>[[Declaration of Independence]]:</strong> Jefferson&rsquo;s articulation of natural rights directly reflects Locke&rsquo;s influence, justifying the American Revolution.</li>
<li><strong>US Constitution:</strong> The structure of the US government, with its emphasis on separation of powers and checks and balances, reflects Montesquieu&rsquo;s ideas. The [[Bill of Rights]] protects individual liberties consistent with [[Enlightenment]] principles.</li>
<li><strong>Republicanism:</strong> The [[Enlightenment]] fostered a shift away from monarchy and towards republican ideals of self-government and popular sovereignty.</li>
<li><strong>Abolitionist Movement:</strong>  While the [[Enlightenment]]&rsquo;s legacy is complex concerning slavery, its emphasis on natural rights provided a moral basis for later abolitionist arguments.</li>
<li><strong>Education and Scientific Inquiry:</strong> The [[Enlightenment]] spurred advancements in education and scientific investigation, emphasizing reason and empirical observation.</li>
