<h2 id="when-late-19th-and-early-20th-centuries-roughly-1870s-1913">When: Late 19th and early 20th centuries (roughly 1870s-1913)</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./../j/">J</a>. Pierpont Morgan:</strong>  Financier, banker, and philanthropist.  Head of <a href="./../j/">J</a>.P. Morgan &amp; Co.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p><a href="./../j/">J</a>.P. Morgan was a highly influential figure in American finance during the <a href="./../gilded-age/">Gilded Age</a>. He dominated corporate finance, railroad reorganization, and industrial consolidation.  Key activities include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Railroad Reorganization:</strong> Restructured numerous bankrupt railroads, creating more efficient and profitable systems through consolidation and financial maneuvering.</li>
<li><strong>Industrial Consolidation:</strong> Played a major role in forming massive trusts and holding companies, including U.S. Steel (1901), the largest corporation ever at the time.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Panics:</strong>  Often stepped in during financial crises to stabilize the economy, lending money to the government and other institutions (e.g., during the Panic of 1907).</li>
<li><strong>International Finance:</strong>  Had significant influence in international markets and often brokered loans to foreign governments.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consolidation of Industry:</strong> Created monopolies and oligopolies, significantly shaping the American industrial landscape.  This led to increased efficiency but also concerns about economic power concentration.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Power:</strong> Exercised immense influence over the American economy, demonstrating the growing power of finance capital.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Stability (arguably):</strong>  While his actions benefited him greatly, his interventions in financial panics sometimes prevented economic collapse.</li>
<li><strong>Philanthropy:</strong>  Donated significantly to various institutions, including libraries and universities.  However, this philanthropy was intertwined with his business interests and image building.</li>
<li><strong>Debate over Capitalism:</strong>  Morgan&rsquo;s actions fueled debates about the nature and ethics of laissez-faire capitalism and the growing power of big business.  His methods contributed to the rise of Progressive Era reforms aiming to curb corporate power.</li>
