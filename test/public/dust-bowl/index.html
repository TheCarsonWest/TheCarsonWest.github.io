<h2 id="when-1930-1936-peak-years-though-effects-lingered-longer-worst-years-were-1934-1935">When: 1930-1936 (Peak years, though effects lingered longer); worst years were 1934-1935</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Farmers:</strong> Particularly those in the Southern Plains region ([[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], [[Colorado]], [[New Mexico]]) were most affected.</li>
<li><strong>Federal Government:</strong> Agencies like the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) were created to address the problem.</li>
<li><strong>Migrant Workers (Okies):</strong> Many farmers were forced to migrate westward in search of work.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A severe ecological and human disaster that struck the Southern Plains region of the [[United States]]. It was characterized by prolonged drought, high winds, and over-farming of the land, leading to massive dust storms that swept across the region. Topsoil was eroded, farms were destroyed, and many people were displaced.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental Disaster:</strong> One of the worst man-made ecological disasters in American history, highlighting the importance of sustainable farming practices.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Hardship:</strong> Exacerbated the [[Great Depression]] in the affected regions, leading to widespread poverty and unemployment.</li>
<li><strong>Migration and Displacement:</strong> Forced thousands of families (primarily from [[Oklahoma]], nicknamed &ldquo;Okies&rdquo;) to migrate westward, mainly to [[California]], in search of work and survival. This created new social and economic challenges in the destination states.</li>
<li><strong>Government Intervention:</strong> Led to the creation of federal programs and agencies, such as the Soil Conservation Service (now the Natural Resources Conservation Service), to promote soil conservation and sustainable agriculture. Demonstrated the need for government intervention in environmental and agricultural crises.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural Impact:</strong> The [[Dust Bowl]] became a symbol of the hardships of the [[Great Depression]] and was depicted in literature, art, and music, most notably in John Steinbeck&rsquo;s The Grapes of Wrath. Raised awareness about the impact of human actions on the environment.</li>
