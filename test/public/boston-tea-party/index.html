<h2 id="when-december-16-1773">When: December 16, 1773</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./../sons-of-liberty/">Sons of Liberty</a>:</strong>  A group of American colonists who organized and participated in the event.  Key figures included <a href="./../samuel-adams/">Samuel Adams</a>, but many others participated.</li>
<li><strong>British East India Company:</strong> The target of the protest, whose tea monopoly was the issue.</li>
<li><strong>British Authorities:</strong>  Initially, they were largely passive observers though later responded with the <a href="./../intolerable-acts/">Intolerable Acts</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A political protest by the <a href="./../sons-of-liberty/">Sons of Liberty</a> in Boston, <a href="./../massachusetts/">Massachusetts</a>, where colonists disguised as Mohawk Indians boarded three British ships and dumped 342 chests of tea into Boston Harbor to protest the <a href="./../tea-act/">Tea Act</a>.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Escalation of Tensions:</strong> The <a href="./../boston-tea-party/">Boston Tea Party</a> significantly escalated tensions between <a href="./../great-britain/">Great Britain</a> and the American colonies. It was a bold act of defiance that directly challenged British authority.</li>
<li><strong><a href="./../intolerable-acts/">Intolerable Acts</a>:</strong> The British government responded with the <a href="./../intolerable-acts/">Intolerable Acts</a> (also known as the Coercive Acts), a series of punitive measures designed to punish <a href="./../massachusetts/">Massachusetts</a> and assert British control.  These acts further inflamed colonial resentment.</li>
<li><strong>Movement Towards Revolution:</strong> The event marked a crucial step toward the American Revolution. It demonstrated the growing colonial resistance to British policies and contributed to the growing sentiment for independence.</li>
<li><strong>Propaganda and Symbolism:</strong> The <a href="./../boston-tea-party/">Boston Tea Party</a> became a powerful symbol of colonial resistance and was widely publicized throughout the colonies, fostering unity among the colonists.</li>
<li><strong>Taxation Without Representation:</strong> The event highlighted the colonists&rsquo; central grievance: taxation without representation. The <a href="./../tea-act/">Tea Act</a>, while seemingly beneficial on the surface, was viewed as an attempt to undermine colonial merchants and force acceptance of taxation without colonial consent.</li>
