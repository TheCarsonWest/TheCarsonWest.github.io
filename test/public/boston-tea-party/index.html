<h2 id="when-december-16-1773">When: December 16, 1773</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sons of Liberty:</strong>  A group of American colonists who organized and participated in the event.  Key figures included Samuel Adams, but many others participated.</li>
<li><strong>British East India Company:</strong> The target of the protest, whose tea monopoly was the issue.</li>
<li><strong>British Authorities:</strong>  Initially, they were largely passive observers though later responded with the Intolerable Acts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A political protest by the Sons of Liberty in Boston, Massachusetts, where colonists disguised as Mohawk Indians boarded three British ships and dumped 342 chests of tea into Boston Harbor to protest the Tea Act.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Escalation of Tensions:</strong> The Boston Tea Party significantly escalated tensions between Great Britain and the American colonies. It was a bold act of defiance that directly challenged British authority.</li>
<li><strong>Intolerable Acts:</strong> The British government responded with the Intolerable Acts (also known as the Coercive Acts), a series of punitive measures designed to punish Massachusetts and assert British control.  These acts further inflamed colonial resentment.</li>
<li><strong>Movement Towards Revolution:</strong> The event marked a crucial step toward the American Revolution. It demonstrated the growing colonial resistance to British policies and contributed to the growing sentiment for independence.</li>
<li><strong>Propaganda and Symbolism:</strong> The Boston Tea Party became a powerful symbol of colonial resistance and was widely publicized throughout the colonies, fostering unity among the colonists.</li>
<li><strong>Taxation Without Representation:</strong> The event highlighted the colonists&rsquo; central grievance: taxation without representation. The Tea Act, while seemingly beneficial on the surface, was viewed as an attempt to undermine colonial merchants and force acceptance of taxation without colonial consent.</li>
