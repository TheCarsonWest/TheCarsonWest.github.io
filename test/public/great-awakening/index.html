<h2 id="when-1730s-1740s">When: 1730s-1740s</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Religious Leaders:</strong> Jonathan Edwards (New England), George Whitefield (traveling evangelist), Gilbert Tennent (<a href="./../new-jersey/">New Jersey</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Participants:</strong>  Colonists from all social classes, although initially more prominent among the less affluent.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A series of religious revivals that swept through the American colonies.  Characterized by passionate preaching, emotional experiences, and a focus on personal conversion rather than traditional church hierarchies.  It emphasized individual piety and a direct relationship with God.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Religious Change:</strong> Led to the growth of evangelical Protestantism and the formation of new denominations, such as Baptists and Methodists.  Challenged the authority of established churches (e.g., Congregationalists, Anglicans).</li>
<li><strong>Social Change:</strong> Transcended class divisions, uniting people from diverse backgrounds through a shared religious experience. However, it also sparked tensions and divisions within communities.</li>
<li><strong>Political Impact:</strong> Fostered a sense of shared identity and experience among colonists, contributing to a growing sense of American identity that later played a role in the Revolution.  The emphasis on individual conscience also had implications for later political thought.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Literacy:</strong> The desire to read the Bible spurred literacy rates.</li>
<li><strong>Development of Colleges:</strong>  New colleges were founded (e.g., Princeton, Dartmouth) to train ministers for the growing evangelical movement.</li>
