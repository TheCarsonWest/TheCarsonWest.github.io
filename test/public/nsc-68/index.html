<h2 id="when-april-14-1950">WHEN: April 14, 1950</h2>
<h2 id="who">WHO:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authored by the State Department and Defense Department under President Harry S. Truman. Key figures involved include Paul Nitze.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">WHAT:</h2>
<p>A top-secret National Security Council policy paper (NSC-68) presented to President Truman. It outlined a comprehensive strategic approach to combating the perceived threat of Soviet expansionism and communism globally. It advocated for a massive buildup of the US military, a stronger containment policy, and a more assertive role for the [[United States]] in world affairs. The document framed the [[Cold War]] as a fundamental conflict between freedom and slavery. It called for a global commitment to containing Soviet influence.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">IMPACT: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Militarization of Containment:</strong> [[NSC-68]] significantly shifted US foreign policy towards a more militaristic approach to containment. It advocated for a dramatic increase in military spending and the development of new weapons, including the hydrogen bomb.</li>
<li><strong>Global Commitment:</strong> It led to a broadened and more global understanding of containment, committing the [[United States]] to intervening in various parts of the world to prevent the spread of communism.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Defense Spending:</strong> Directly resulted in a massive increase in the US defense budget, laying the foundation for the military-industrial complex Eisenhower would later warn against.</li>
<li><strong>Korean War Justification:</strong> The outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950 provided immediate justification for the policies outlined in [[NSC-68]] and accelerated its implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Cold War Escalation:</strong> [[NSC-68]] contributed to the escalation of the [[Cold War]] by solidifying the ideological divide and increasing the potential for military confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Foreign Policy:</strong> [[NSC-68]] shaped US foreign policy for decades to come, influencing interventions in Vietnam, Latin America, and other regions during the Cold War. It contributed to a globalized [[Cold War]] framework.</li>
