<h2 id="when-october-16-28-1962">WHEN: October 16-28, 1962</h2>
<h2 id="who">WHO:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>United States:</strong> President John F. Kennedy, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara</li>
<li><strong>Soviet Union:</strong> Premier Nikita Khrushchev</li>
<li><strong>Cuba:</strong> Fidel Castro</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">WHAT:</h2>
<p>A 13-day confrontation between the [[United States]] and the Soviet Union initiated by the American discovery of Soviet nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba, just 90 miles from the U.S. mainland. Kennedy ordered a naval &ldquo;quarantine&rdquo; (blockade) of Cuba to prevent further Soviet shipments and demanded the removal of the existing missiles. Negotiations ensued between the US and the USSR, teetering on the brink of nuclear war. Ultimately, a deal was reached where the Soviets agreed to remove the missiles from Cuba in exchange for a US pledge not to invade Cuba and a secret agreement to remove US Jupiter missiles from Turkey.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">IMPACT: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Closest to Nuclear War:</strong> Considered the closest the world has ever come to nuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Test Ban Treaty (1963):</strong> Led to increased efforts towards arms control and a desire to reduce tensions. The Limited Test Ban Treaty prohibited nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere, outer space, and underwater.</li>
<li><strong>Hotline Established:</strong> A direct communication &ldquo;hotline&rdquo; was established between [[Washington]] D.C. and Moscow to facilitate direct communication between leaders in future crises.</li>
<li><strong>Shifting [[Cold War]] Dynamics:</strong> The crisis exposed the dangers of [[Cold War]] brinkmanship and the need for more cautious and nuanced diplomacy. It somewhat changed the relationship between the US and USSR.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Cuba:</strong> Strengthened Castro&rsquo;s regime in Cuba, as the US pledged not to invade. However, Cuba remained a focal point of US foreign policy throughout the Cold War.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Mistrust:</strong> Although a deal was met, both sides left the crisis with increased mistrust of the others intentions.</li>
