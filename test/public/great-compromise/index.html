<li><strong>Roger Sherman</strong> and <strong>Oliver Ellsworth</strong> ([[Connecticut]] Delegates) proposed the compromise.</li>
<li><strong>William Paterson</strong> proposed the [[New Jersey]] Plan, favoring smaller states.</li>
<li><strong>[[James Madison]]</strong> proposed the [[Virginia]] Plan, favoring larger states.</li>

<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A major compromise reached during the [[Constitutional Convention]]|[[Constitutional Convention]] that resolved the issue of representation in the legislative branch.

<p><strong>Key Features of the Compromise:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bicameral Legislature:</strong>  Created a two-house Congress:
<ul>
<li><strong>Senate:</strong> Each state would have equal representation (2 senators per state).</li>
<li><strong>House of Representatives:</strong> Representation would be based on the population of each state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Shaped the U.S. Government:</strong>  The bicameral legislature with its distinct features remains a cornerstone of the U.S. government today.</li>
<li><strong>Balance of Power:</strong> It established a balance of power between larger and smaller states, ensuring that both had a voice in the federal government. This balance remains a key characteristic of American democracy.</li>
