<h2 id="when-1865-1900-peak-activity-in-the-late-19th-century--with-significant-events-occurring-throughout-this-period--specific-union-actions-and-legislation-will-have-more-precise-dates">When: 1865-1900 (Peak activity in the late 19th century,  with significant events occurring throughout this period.  Specific union actions and legislation will have more precise dates.)</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Workers:</strong> Unskilled and skilled laborers in various industries (e.g., mining, railroads, factories).  Immigrants formed a large part of the workforce and union membership.</li>
<li><strong>Union Leaders:</strong>  Figures like Samuel Gompers (AFL), Terence V. Powderly (Knights of Labor).</li>
<li><strong>Employers/Business Owners:</strong>  Powerful industrialists (e.g., [[Andrew Carnegie]], [[John D. Rockefeller]]) who often resisted unionization.</li>
<li><strong>Government:</strong>  Initially largely laissez-faire, but later became more involved in regulating labor relations (though often siding with business interests).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>The rise of labor unions in response to harsh working conditions during the [[Gilded Age]].  Workers sought better wages, shorter hours, safer working conditions, and improved benefits.  Several major unions emerged, employing various strategies including strikes, boycotts, and political action.  The period saw significant conflict between labor and capital, marked by several major strikes and violent confrontations.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth of Organized Labor:</strong>  The [[Gilded Age]] witnessed the significant growth and development of the American labor movement, establishing the foundation for future labor organizations.</li>
<li><strong>Social and Economic Change:</strong> Unions fought for improved living standards and worker rights, impacting the lives of millions of Americans and contributing to social reform movements.</li>
<li><strong>Government Regulation:</strong>  While often slow, the increased labor unrest prompted some governmental intervention in labor relations, laying the groundwork for future labor laws.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Class Conflict:</strong>  The era saw heightened tensions between workers and industrialists, leading to significant social and political unrest.</li>
<li><strong>Key Events:</strong>  Haymarket Riot (1886), Pullman Strike (1894), Homestead Strike (1892) â€“ these events highlight the intensity of labor struggles and government responses.</li>
<li><strong>Formation of Key Unions:</strong>  Knights of Labor (early focus on broad inclusivity), American Federation of Labor (AFL) (focus on skilled workers and craft unions).  These unions differed in their strategies and goals.</li>
