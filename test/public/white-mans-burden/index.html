<h2 id="who--rudyard-kipling-author">Who:  Rudyard Kipling (author)</h2>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A poem published in McClure&rsquo;s Magazine, expressing the belief that it was the moral obligation of white, Western nations to colonize and &ldquo;civilize&rdquo; non-white peoples.  It justified imperialism and the belief in white racial superiority.  The poem uses paternalistic and condescending language to describe the supposed &ldquo;burden&rdquo; of ruling over less developed nations.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Justification for Imperialism:</strong> Kipling&rsquo;s poem provided a powerful ideological justification for American imperialism in the Philippines and elsewhere. It resonated with those who supported expansionism, framing it as a benevolent mission.</li>
<li><strong>Racial Superiority:</strong> The poem&rsquo;s central theme was the idea of white racial superiority and the supposed inability of non-white peoples to govern themselves. This contributed to racist attitudes and policies throughout the early 20th century.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-Imperialist Opposition:</strong>  While supporting the cause of expansionists, it also fueled the anti-imperialist movement in the US.  Critics attacked the poem&rsquo;s racist assumptions and the exploitative nature of imperialism.</li>
<li><strong>Shaped Public Opinion:</strong> The poem&rsquo;s widespread dissemination significantly shaped public opinion about America&rsquo;s role in the world, influencing how the American public perceived the acquisition of overseas territories.</li>
<li><strong>Lasting Legacy:</strong> The phrase &ldquo;White Man&rsquo;s Burden&rdquo; continues to be used to describe the justification of colonialism and other forms of imperialism, highlighting the negative legacy of such ideologies.  It serves as a reminder of the harmful effects of racial prejudice and the exploitative nature of empire-building.</li>
