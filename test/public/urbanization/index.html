<p>Rapid growth of cities due to industrialization and immigration.

<li><strong>Rise of <a href="./../progressivism/">Progressivism</a>:</strong> The problems associated with urbanization spurred the Progressive movement, which aimed to reform society and address urban ills.</li>
<li><strong><a href="./../political-machines/">Political Machines</a> and Corruption:</strong> The rapid growth created opportunities for political corruption and the rise of powerful political machines that controlled city governments.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural Diversity and Conflict:</strong> The influx of immigrants led to increased cultural diversity but also resulted in ethnic tensions and discrimination.</li>
<li><strong>Technological Advancements:</strong> <a href="./../urbanization/">Urbanization</a> spurred technological innovations in transportation (subways, streetcars), sanitation, and building construction.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in Demographics:</strong>  A dramatic shift in the population from rural areas to urban centers, fundamentally altering the American identity.  This impacted voting patterns and political power significantly.</li>
