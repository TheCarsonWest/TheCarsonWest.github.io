<p>Franklin Delano Roosevelt, often referred to by his initials FDR, was the 32nd President of the [[United States]], serving from 1933 until his death in 1945. His presidency is largely defined by his response to the [[Great Depression]] and his leadership during World War II.</p>
<h2 id="key-events-and-associations">Key Events and Associations:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>[[Great Depression]]:</strong> FDR inherited the economic crisis triggered by the [[Stock Market Crash of 1929]]. His administration implemented the [[New Deal]], a series of programs and reforms aimed at relief, recovery, and reform.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Pearl Harbor:</strong> Before the attack, FDR ordered an oil embargo on Japan, which was attempting to expand its empire into Asia. On December 7th, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor which led to the US joining WWII.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="important-legislation-and-programs">Important Legislation and Programs:</h2>

<h2 id="impact-on-the-country">Impact on the Country:</h2>

<li><strong>Legacy of Hope:</strong> Despite facing immense challenges, FDR inspired hope and confidence in the American people. His [[Fireside Chats]] and optimistic leadership helped the nation overcome the [[Great Depression]] and win World War II.</li>
<li><strong>Controversies:</strong> While immensely popular, FDR&rsquo;s presidency also faced criticism. Some conservatives opposed the expansion of government power and the growth of the national debt. Others criticized his handling of foreign policy prior to World War II, arguing he should have intervened sooner.</li>
</ul>
<p>FDR&rsquo;s presidency remains one of the most consequential in American history, shaping the modern role of government and solidifying the United States&rsquo; position as a global superpower.</p>
