<h2 id="who-john-f-kennedyjohn-f-kennedy-president">WHO: <a href="./../john-f.-kennedy/">John F. Kennedy</a> (President)</h2>
<h2 id="what">WHAT:</h2>
<p>A slogan used by President <a href="./../john-f.-kennedy/">John F. Kennedy</a> to describe his goals and policies. It encompassed both domestic and foreign policy initiatives aimed at improving American society and projecting American strength abroad. Key elements included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domestic Policy:</strong> Increased federal spending on education, healthcare, and urban renewal; civil rights legislation; and a focus on scientific and technological advancement.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Policy:</strong> <a href="./../containment/">Containment</a> of communism, Peace Corps, Alliance for Progress, and a focus on the space race.</li>
<li><strong>Overall Theme:</strong>  A call to national unity, public service, and progress.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">IMPACT: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inspired Hope and Activism:</strong> The &ldquo;New Frontier&rdquo; inspired a generation of Americans to get involved in public service and social change.</li>
<li><strong>Expansion of Government Role:</strong>  Led to an expansion of the federal government&rsquo;s role in addressing social and economic problems. Increased spending on social programs and defense.</li>
<li><strong>Civil Rights Movement Momentum:</strong> Laid the groundwork for significant civil rights legislation, although Kennedy was often hesitant to fully commit due to political considerations.</li>
<li><strong>Space Race Intensification:</strong>  Fueled the &ldquo;space race&rdquo; with the Soviet Union, leading to significant advancements in science and technology (and ultimately the moon landing).</li>
<li><strong>Mixed Success:</strong> While some initiatives were successful, others faced opposition in Congress and were not fully realized during Kennedy&rsquo;s short presidency. His assassination left many goals incomplete, but served as inspiration for future administrations.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy:</strong> Shaped the Democratic Party&rsquo;s platform for years to come and continues to be a symbol of progressive ideals and government activism.</li>
