<hr>
<p><strong>What it Was:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>English joint-stock company chartered by King James I.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To establish colonies in North America for profit (gold, other resources, potential Northwest Passage) and compete with Spain.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Dates/Events:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1606:</strong> Granted a royal charter by King James I.</li>
<li><strong>1607:</strong> Established <strong>Jamestown, Virginia</strong>, the first permanent English settlement in North America.</li>
<li><strong>Initial Struggles (1607 onwards):</strong> Faced immense challenges including disease (malaria, dysentery), famine (the &ldquo;Starving Time&rdquo; largely begins just after 1607 but its roots are here), and hostile relations with the <strong>Powhatan Confederacy</strong> (local Native American tribe).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key People:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>King James I:</strong> Granted the charter, hoping for wealth and expansion of English influence.</li>
<li><strong>English Investors/Merchants:</strong> Funded the company, seeking financial returns.</li>
<li><strong>John Smith:</strong> Early leader at Jamestown; imposed strict discipline (&ldquo;no work, no eat&rdquo;) crucial for the colony&rsquo;s survival in its initial years (present in 1607).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance (within Period 1):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Permanent English Colony:</strong> Successfully established Jamestown, laying the groundwork for English colonization in the Americas.</li>
<li><strong>Joint-Stock Model:</strong> Pioneered this new economic model for funding overseas ventures, distributing risk among investors.</li>
<li><strong>Early Native American Relations:</strong> Marked the beginning of sustained, and often conflict-ridden, interactions between English settlers and Native American tribes in North America (specifically the Powhatan).</li>
<li><strong>Foundation for Chesapeake:</strong> Set the stage for the development of the Chesapeake Bay region, even though its later economic and social structures (tobacco, slavery) fully emerge after 1607.</li>
</ul>
