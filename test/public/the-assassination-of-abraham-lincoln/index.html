<h2 id="when-april-14-1865">When: April 14, 1865</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>John Wilkes Booth:</strong> Confederate sympathizer and actor.</li>
<li><strong>[[Abraham Lincoln]]:</strong> President of the [[United States]].</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathizer, assassinated President [[Abraham Lincoln]] at Ford&rsquo;s Theatre in [[Washington]] D.C. Booth shot Lincoln in the back of the head while he was watching a play. Lincoln died the following morning.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marked a period of national grief and shock.</strong> Lincoln&rsquo;s assassination plunged the nation into mourning and heightened fears of further violence.</li>
<li><strong>Contributed to the rise of [[Andrew Johnson]] as President.</strong> Johnson, Lincoln&rsquo;s Vice President, assumed the presidency and faced the difficult task of rebuilding the nation after the [[Civil War]].</li>
<li><strong>Significantly impacted the Reconstruction Era.</strong> Lincoln&rsquo;s assassination left a void in leadership at a critical time for the nation. Johnson&rsquo;s Reconstruction policies differed significantly from Lincoln&rsquo;s, leading to a more lenient approach towards the South.</li>
<li><strong>Elevated Lincoln to the status of a martyr.</strong> His assassination solidified his place in history as a great leader and a symbol of the Union&rsquo;s victory.</li>
<li><strong>Led to increased efforts to apprehend Booth and his co-conspirators.</strong>  The assassination prompted a widespread manhunt for Booth and his accomplices, resulting in their capture and trial.</li>
