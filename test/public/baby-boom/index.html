<h2 id="when-1946-1964">When: 1946-1964</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>

<p>A significant increase in the birth rate following World War II in the United States. This led to a dramatic rise in the population, creating a generation known as the &ldquo;Baby Boomers.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Population Growth:</strong> Increased the U.S. population significantly, shaping demographics for decades.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Boom:</strong> Fueled economic expansion as demand increased for goods and services to support the growing population (housing, schools, consumer goods).</li>
<li><strong>Suburbanization:</strong> Contributed to the growth of suburbs as families sought larger homes outside of cities.</li>
<li><strong>Social and Cultural Changes:</strong> Baby Boomers influenced societal norms, values, and cultural trends as they came of age, impacting education, music, fashion, and social activism (e.g., the counterculture movement of the 1960s).</li>
<li><strong>Strain on Resources:</strong> Placed demands on resources and infrastructure (schools, hospitals, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Future Implications:</strong> As Baby Boomers aged, they placed strains on Social Security and Medicare systems. The sheer size of the generation continues to shape policy debates today.</li>
