<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>A tangent line is a line that touches a curve at a single point and has the same slope as the curve at that point. Tangent lines are fundamental concepts in calculus because they allow us to approximate the behavior of a function near a specific point.</p>
<h3 id="finding-the-equation-of-a-tangent-line">Finding the Equation of a Tangent Line</h3>
<p>To find the equation of a tangent line to a curve  $ y=f(x) $  at a point  $ (a, f(a)) $ , we follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Find the slope of the tangent line.</strong> This slope is equal to the derivative of the function at  $ x=a $ , denoted by  $ f&rsquo;(a) $ .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use the point-slope form of a line.</strong> The point-slope form of a line is given by:
$$ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) $$      where  $ m $  is the slope and  $ (x_1, y_1) $  is a point on the line. In our case,  $ m = f&rsquo;(a) $  and  $ (x_1, y_1) = (a, f(a)) $ .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Substitute the values into the point-slope form and simplify to get the equation of the tangent line.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find the equation of the tangent line to the curve  $ y = x^2 $  at the point  $ (2, 4) $ .</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Find the derivative:</strong>  $ f&rsquo;(x) = 2x $ .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evaluate the derivative at  $ x=2 $ :</strong>  $ f&rsquo;(2) = 4 $ .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use the point-slope form:</strong>
$$ y - 4 = 4(x - 2) $$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplify:</strong>
$$ y = 4x - 4 $$<br>
Therefore, the equation of the tangent line to the curve  $ y = x^2 $  at the point  $ (2, 4) $  is  $ y = 4x - 4 $ .</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="derivatives-and-tangent-lines">Derivatives and Tangent Lines</h3>
<p>The derivative of a function at a point gives the slope of the tangent line to the function&rsquo;s graph at that point. This connection between derivatives and tangent lines is crucial in calculus.</p>
<p>For example, if the derivative of a function is positive at a point, the tangent line at that point will have a positive slope, indicating that the function is increasing at that point. Similarly, if the derivative is negative, the tangent line will have a negative slope, indicating that the function is decreasing.</p>
<h3 id="applications-of-tangent-linesapplications-of-tangent-lines"><a href="./../applications-of-tangent-lines/">Applications of Tangent Lines</a></h3>
<p>Tangent lines have numerous applications in various fields, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Physics:</strong> Tangent lines are used to find the velocity and acceleration of an object at a given time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engineering:</strong> Tangent lines are used in design and optimization problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Economics:</strong> Tangent lines are used to analyze marginal cost and marginal revenue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="visual-representation">Visual Representation</h3>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-desmos-graph" data-lang="desmos-graph">y = x^2
y = 4x - 4
</code></pre><p>This graph shows the curve  $ y = x^2 $  and the tangent line  $ y = 4x - 4 $  at the point  $ (2, 4) $ . We can see that the tangent line touches the curve at a single point and has the same slope as the curve at that point.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Tangent lines are an essential concept in calculus, connecting the derivative of a function to the slope of its graph at a particular point. They have numerous applications in various fields and are crucial for understanding the behavior of functions.</p>
