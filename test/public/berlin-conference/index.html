<ul>
<li><strong>Imperialism:</strong> The core driving force.</li>
<li><strong>Colonialism:</strong> The direct result of the conference.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitics:</strong>  The conference was a prime example of power politics.</li>
<li><strong>Arbitrary Boundaries:</strong>  The most significant and lasting negative impact.</li>
<li><strong>Scramble for Africa:</strong>  The intense competition for African territory.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rundown:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. What Happened:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Officially, the Berlin Conference aimed to regulate European colonization and trade in Africa during the New Imperialism period. In reality, it was a meeting to peacefully divide Africa among European powers, preventing war between them.</li>
<li><strong>Process:</strong>  From November 1884 to February 1885, representatives from 14 European states (and the United States, although it didn&rsquo;t ratify the treaty) met in Berlin, Germany, under the invitation of Otto von Bismarck, the Chancellor of Germany.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The conference established rules for claiming African territory.  The principle of &ldquo;effective occupation&rdquo; was key: a European power had to demonstrate control over an area to claim it, including having a treaty with a local leader, flying their flag, and establishing an administration. This triggered a rush by European powers to secure treaties and establish control.</li>
<li><strong>No African Representation:</strong>  Critically, no African rulers or representatives were invited or consulted during the conference.  The continent was carved up with complete disregard for existing political, cultural, and ethnic boundaries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Groups and People Involved:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Major European Powers:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Great Britain:</strong> Sought to secure a Cape-to-Cairo route and control key strategic areas.</li>
<li><strong>France:</strong> Aimed for control of West Africa and a trans-Saharan empire.</li>
<li><strong>Germany:</strong>  A relatively latecomer to the colonial game, sought to establish its presence and prestige.</li>
<li><strong>Belgium:</strong>  King Leopold II personally controlled the Congo Free State, a vast and brutally exploited territory.</li>
<li><strong>Portugal:</strong>  Sought to consolidate its existing coastal colonies in Angola and Mozambique.</li>
<li><strong>Italy:</strong>  Attempted to gain territories, but met with limited success.</li>
<li><strong>Spain:</strong>  Held onto small territories.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Key Individuals:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Otto von Bismarck (Germany):</strong>  Hosted the conference and sought to maintain peace among European powers while expanding German influence.</li>
<li><strong>King Leopold II (Belgium):</strong>  Played a significant role in the conference and gained control of the Congo Free State.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>African Populations:</strong>  The most affected group, but completely excluded from the decision-making process.  Existing empires, kingdoms, and tribal structures were ignored.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Lasting Impact on the World:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arbitrary Boundaries:</strong>  The most significant and enduring legacy.  European powers drew borders with no regard for existing ethnic, linguistic, or cultural groups. This led to:
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal Conflict:</strong>  Many African nations inherited borders that forced disparate groups to live together, leading to civil wars, ethnic tensions, and political instability after independence.</li>
<li><strong>Weakened States:</strong>  These artificial boundaries often hampered the development of strong, unified national identities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Economic Exploitation:</strong>  The conference facilitated the extraction of resources from Africa, benefiting European economies while hindering African development.  Colonial economies were structured to serve the needs of the colonizers.</li>
<li><strong>Political Instability:</strong>  The legacy of colonialism continues to affect African politics. Weak institutions, corruption, and a lack of democratic traditions are often linked to the colonial past.</li>
<li><strong>Neocolonialism:</strong> Even after independence, many African nations remain economically dependent on former colonial powers and other developed countries.  This is often achieved through trade agreements, debt, and political influence.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Implications:</strong> The Berlin Conference set a precedent for international agreements that prioritized the interests of powerful nations over the rights and self-determination of others. This legacy continues to shape global power dynamics.</li>
<li><strong>Population Distribution:</strong> The arbitrary borders caused mass migrations as people tried to live with their ethnic group.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural Impacts:</strong>  The introduction of European languages, education systems, and religions had a profound and lasting impact on African cultures.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AP Human Geography Connections:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Political Geography:</strong>  The Berlin Conference is a prime example of how political decisions can create artificial boundaries and lead to conflict. It illustrates the concept of state morphology and how shapes and boundaries impact a state&rsquo;s functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Geography:</strong>  The conference highlights the economic motivations behind imperialism and the unequal distribution of resources that resulted from colonialism.  It demonstrates core-periphery relationships and dependency theory.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural Geography:</strong>  The conference illustrates the imposition of European culture on African societies and the resulting cultural changes and conflicts.</li>
<li><strong>Development Geography:</strong>  The conference is a key factor in understanding the underdevelopment of many African nations.  It shows how colonial policies hindered economic growth and created lasting inequalities.</li>
<li><strong>Population Geography:</strong> The conference led to the forced migration of thousands of Africans.</li>
<li><strong>Urban Geography:</strong> Colonial cities often were designed to extract resources from other parts of the country. This led to uneven development.</li>
</ul>
