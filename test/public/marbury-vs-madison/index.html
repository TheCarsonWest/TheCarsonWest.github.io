<h2 id="when-february-24-1803">When: February 24, 1803</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>William Marbury:</strong>  A Federalist Party member appointed as Justice of the Peace by outgoing President <a href="./../john-adams/">John Adams</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="./../james-madison/">James Madison</a>:</strong> Secretary of State under President <a href="./../thomas-jefferson/">Thomas Jefferson</a>.</li>
<li><strong>John Marshall:</strong> Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A Supreme Court case stemming from President Jefferson&rsquo;s refusal to deliver commissions (official appointments) to Federalist judges appointed by Adams in his last days as President. Marbury sued for his commission.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact? Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Established Judicial Review:</strong>  The Supreme Court, under Chief Justice John Marshall, ruled that part of the <a href="./../judiciary-act/">Judiciary Act</a> of 1789, which gave the Supreme Court the power to issue writs of mandamus (forcing government officials to do their duty), was unconstitutional. This ruling established the principle of judicial review, giving the Supreme Court the power to declare laws unconstitutional.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthened the Judicial Branch:</strong> The decision dramatically increased the power and influence of the judicial branch, making it an equal branch of government to the legislative and executive branches.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Impact:</strong> Marbury v. Madison remains a cornerstone of American government, ensuring a balance of power and safeguarding the Constitution.</li>
