<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./../benjamin-franklin/">Benjamin Franklin</a>:</strong> Primary author and proponent.</li>
<li><strong>Representatives from seven colonies:</strong>  Attended the Albany Congress.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A proposal by <a href="./../benjamin-franklin/">Benjamin Franklin</a> for a unified government for the thirteen British colonies in North America.  The plan called for a President-General appointed by the King and a Grand Council elected by the colonial legislatures. This unified government would handle issues such as defense, western expansion, and Native American relations.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>First significant attempt at colonial unity:</strong>  The Albany Plan represented the first serious effort to create a unified government for the colonies before the American Revolution.  Though ultimately unsuccessful in its immediate aims, it laid the groundwork for future discussions about colonial unity and self-governance.</li>
<li><strong>Illustrates growing colonial identity:</strong> The very act of convening the Albany Congress and debating the plan indicates a growing sense of shared identity and purpose among the colonists.</li>
<li><strong>Failure highlights inter-colonial tensions:</strong> The plan&rsquo;s failure to be adopted by the colonial legislatures revealed the significant divisions and competing interests that existed among the colonies.  Colonies were wary of surrendering power to a central authority.</li>
<li><strong>Precursor to later union efforts:</strong> The Albany Plan&rsquo;s ideas about representation, taxation, and shared governance prefigured similar discussions that would take place during and after the American Revolution, ultimately leading to the creation of the <a href="./../articles-of-confederation/">Articles of Confederation</a> and the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> Constitution.</li>
