<h2 id="when-late-19th-and-early-20th-centuries-focus-on-conditions-around-april-12-1901-as-a-representative-point">When: Late 19th and early 20th centuries (focus on conditions around April 12, 1901 as a representative point)</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immigrants and Low-Income Workers:</strong> Primarily the residents of tenement buildings.</li>
<li><strong>Landlords:</strong> Often prioritized profit over living conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Reformers:</strong>  Jacob Riis (photographer and journalist) documented the conditions, influencing public awareness and reform efforts.  Others like Jane Addams (<a href="./../hull-house/">Hull House</a>) worked directly to improve lives in these communities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>Overcrowded, unsanitary, and dangerous multi-family dwellings prevalent in rapidly growing urban areas.  Conditions included inadequate ventilation, lighting, sanitation (shared toilets, lack of running water), fire hazards, and disease spread. April 12th, 1901 serves as a representative date; the conditions were ongoing and widespread at this time.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Health Crisis:</strong> High rates of disease and mortality among tenement residents due to unsanitary living conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Social Problems:</strong> Poverty, crime, and social unrest linked to overcrowding and poor living conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Progressive Reform:</strong> Jacob Riis&rsquo;s photography (&quot;<a href="./../how-the-other-half-lives/">How the Other Half Lives</a>&quot;) and other investigative journalism brought the issue to public attention, fueling the Progressive Era&rsquo;s reform efforts aimed at improving housing conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Tenement Reform Laws:</strong>  <a href="./../new-york/">New York</a> and other cities passed legislation mandating minimum standards for tenement construction and occupancy, including improved sanitation, ventilation, and fire safety. This represents a step toward improved public health and welfare.</li>
<li><strong>Urban Planning:</strong> The problems of tenement housing contributed to the growing movement for urban planning and reform, pushing for improved infrastructure, public services, and better living standards in cities.</li>
