<p>These notes outline strategies for revising and editing written work.  The process is iterative, moving between big-picture concerns and smaller details.</p>
<p><strong>I. Revision (Big Picture):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose &amp; Audience:</strong>  Before diving into specifics, reaffirm the purpose of the writing and who the intended audience is.  This informs all subsequent decisions.  Consider [[Audience Analysis]].</li>
<li><strong>Content &amp; Structure:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thesis Statement:</strong> Is the main argument clear, concise, and compelling?  Does the entire piece support it? [[Thesis Statement Refinement]]</li>
<li><strong>Argumentation:</strong> Are the claims well-supported with evidence? Are there any logical fallacies? [[Logical Fallacies]]</li>
<li><strong>Organization:</strong> Does the flow of ideas make sense? Are transitions smooth and effective? Consider using outlining techniques to improve structure.  [[Outlining Techniques]]</li>
<li><strong>Development:</strong> Is each point sufficiently developed with examples, details, and analysis? Are there any gaps in reasoning or underdeveloped ideas?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Overall Impact:</strong> Does the piece achieve its intended purpose? Is it engaging and persuasive (or informative, depending on the purpose)?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Editing (Line-by-Line):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grammar &amp; Mechanics:</strong> This involves checking for errors in grammar, punctuation, spelling, and sentence structure.  Use a grammar checker, but don&rsquo;t rely on it solely â€“ human judgment is crucial. [[Grammar &amp; Punctuation Rules]]</li>
<li><strong>Style &amp; Tone:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Word Choice:</strong> Are the words precise and effective? Avoid jargon unless the audience understands it. [[Vocabulary &amp; Diction]]</li>
<li><strong>Sentence Structure:</strong> Vary sentence length and structure to avoid monotony.  Are sentences clear and concise? [[Sentence Structure Variety]]</li>
<li><strong>Tone:</strong> Is the tone appropriate for the audience and purpose?  Is it consistent throughout?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Clarity &amp; Conciseness:</strong> Remove any unnecessary words or phrases.  Ensure the writing is easy to understand.  [[Conciseness Techniques]]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Proofreading (Final Check):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Typos &amp; Errors:</strong> This is the final sweep for any remaining errors missed during editing.  Read the piece aloud to catch errors more easily.</li>
<li><strong>Formatting:</strong> Ensure the document is correctly formatted according to guidelines (e.g., font, spacing, citations).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. Iterative Process:</strong> Revision and editing are not linear. Expect to move back and forth between stages, refining and polishing until the work meets your standards.  Consider multiple rounds of revision and editing.</p>
<p><strong>V. Seeking Feedback:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Get feedback from others. [[Peer Review Strategies]]  Their perspective can reveal blind spots in your own work.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Equations (Examples):</strong></p>
<p>The ideal word count can be approximated using this formula:   $ WordCount_{ideal} =  BaseWordCount \times ([[1]] + \alpha \times Difficulty) $  where  $ \alpha $  is a difficulty coefficient.</p>
<p>The efficiency of the editing process can be modeled (though simplistically):
$$ Efficiency = \frac{Errors_{Initial} - Errors_{Final}}{Time_{Spent}} $$</p>
