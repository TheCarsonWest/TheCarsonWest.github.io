<p>Would you still love me if we were down bad and out a home?<br>
I made all my money singin&rsquo; so sad and lonely songs<br>
But all my diamonds came from dirt<br>
The more I love you, the less I hurt<br>
And now my pen can&rsquo;t find the words</p>
<p>I wrote songs about sinnin&rsquo;, evil women, pills, and cars<br>
I wrote songs about drinkin&rsquo; &rsquo;til you walked in and raised the bar<br>
But who am I to write rock bottom from the highs you took me to?<br>
Thank God I was right about you</p>
<p>You can say you hate me as long as you don&rsquo;t mean it<br>
Maybe go half crazy, don&rsquo;t need a rhyme or reason<br>
Girl, you can go and pick a fight, slam that door and lock me outside<br>
Just for one night so I can find a brand new melody</p>
<p>I wrote songs about sinnin&rsquo;, evil women, pills, and cars<br>
I wrote songs about drinkin&rsquo; &rsquo;til you walked in and raised the bar<br>
But who am I to write rock bottom from the highs you took me to?<br>
Thank God I was right about you</p>
<p>I could change up all the chords, get my fingers flowin&rsquo; free<br>
But as long as you&rsquo;re with me, I can have my harmony</p>
<p>I wrote songs about sinnin&rsquo;, evil women, pills, and cars<br>
I wrote songs about drinkin&rsquo; &rsquo;til you walked in and raised the bar<br>
But who am I to write rock bottom from the highs you took me to?<br>
Thank God I was right about you</p>
<p>Thank God I was right about you</p>

          <td style="text-align: left">His romantic partner; potentially also his fans who relate to themes of love and personal transformation.</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">A relationship characterized by significant positive change in the singer&rsquo;s life.  He&rsquo;s reflecting on his past struggles and contrasting them with his current happiness.</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">The singer&rsquo;s past struggles and self-destructive behaviors, juxtaposed with the transformative effect his partner has had on him. This creates a need to express his gratitude and love.</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">Uses a heartfelt and vulnerable tone; employs repetition of the core message (&ldquo;Thank God I was right about you&rdquo;); utilizes metaphors (diamonds from dirt, raising the bar); creates a contrast between his past and present; uses relatable imagery of conflict in a relationship (&ldquo;pick a fight, slam that door&rdquo;).</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">Primarily emotional appeal (evokes feelings of love, gratitude, and relief); also uses some ethical appeal (presents himself as a changed person because of his partner).</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">Affectionate, grateful, vulnerable, reflective, hopeful, slightly apologetic (for his past).  The overall tone is overwhelmingly positive.</td>
