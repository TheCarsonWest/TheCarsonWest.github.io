<h2 id="when-august-21-23-1831">When: August 21-23, 1831</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<p>Nat Turner, a slave preacher and religious mystic, and about 70 enslaved people</p>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A slave rebellion in Southampton County, <a href="./../virginia/">Virginia</a>, in which Turner and his followers killed approximately 60 white people, including women and children.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<p>The rebellion sent shockwaves throughout the South, leading to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased fear and paranoia among white southerners:</strong> This fueled support for stricter slave codes and heightened racial tensions.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthened the institution of slavery:</strong> The rebellion was used as justification for increased slave patrols, harsher punishments, and the suppression of any form of education or religious gatherings for enslaved people.</li>
<li><strong>Limited abolitionist efforts:</strong> The brutality of the rebellion and the resulting white backlash discouraged some abolitionists and made it more difficult to argue for emancipation.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term impact on the South:</strong> The rebellion served as a constant reminder of the potential for slave revolts, contributing to the South&rsquo;s growing sense of isolation and ultimately playing a role in the lead-up to the Civil War.</li>
</ul>
