<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>William Jefferson Clinton, often referred to as Bill Clinton, served as the 42nd <a href="./../potus/">POTUS</a> from 1993 to 2001. His presidency was marked by a period of economic prosperity and domestic policy initiatives, but also faced significant controversy and impeachment proceedings.</p>
<h2 id="key-events-and-policies">Key Events and Policies</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>1993 - Deficit Reduction:</strong> Clinton&rsquo;s early focus was on reducing the federal budget deficit. He signed the <a href="./../omnibus-budget-reconciliation-act-of-1993/">Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993</a>, which combined spending cuts and tax increases.</li>
<li><strong>1993 - North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA):</strong> Supported by Clinton, <a href="./../nafta/">NAFTA</a> aimed to eliminate trade barriers between the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a>, Canada, and Mexico. It proved to be controversial, with supporters claiming economic benefits and opponents raising concerns about job losses and environmental impacts.</li>
<li><strong>1994 - Crime Bill:</strong> The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 was a comprehensive crime bill that increased funding for law enforcement, expanded prisons, and banned certain assault weapons. It&rsquo;s impacts are debated, with some crediting it for a decline in crime rates and others criticizing its contribution to mass incarceration.</li>
<li><strong>1994 - Don&rsquo;t Ask, Don&rsquo;t Tell:</strong> Faced with the issue of gays in the military, Clinton implemented the &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Ask, Don&rsquo;t Tell&rdquo; policy. It allowed gay people to serve in the military as long as they kept their sexuality a secret. The policy was eventually repealed in 2011.</li>
<li><strong>1996 - Welfare Reform:</strong> The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 dramatically reformed the welfare system. It placed time limits on welfare benefits, required recipients to work, and devolved greater control of welfare programs to the states. The long-term effects of this reform remain a subject of debate.</li>
<li><strong>1998 - Lewinsky Scandal and Impeachment:</strong> Clinton&rsquo;s presidency was significantly impacted by his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. This led to impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. He was acquitted by the Senate in 1999.</li>
<li><strong>1999 - Kosovo Intervention:</strong> Clinton authorized military intervention in Kosovo as part of a NATO effort to stop ethnic cleansing and human rights abuses by Serbian forces.</li>
