<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Statistical significance refers to the probability of obtaining results as extreme as, or more extreme than, the results actually observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.  It&rsquo;s typically represented by the p-value.</p>
<p>p-value: The probability of observing the obtained results (or more extreme results) if the null hypothesis were true.  A small p-value (typically &lt; 0.05) suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis, leading to its rejection.   $ p &lt; \alpha $</p>
<p><strong>Null Hypothesis ( $ H_0 $ ):</strong>  A statement that there is no effect, no difference, or no relationship between variables.  For example, in a clinical trial comparing a new drug to a placebo, the null hypothesis might be that there is no difference in effectiveness between the two treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis ( $ H_1 $  or  $ H_a $ ):</strong>  A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. It proposes that there is an effect, difference, or relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Type I Error (False Positive):</strong> Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.  The probability of a Type I error is denoted by  $ \alpha $  (alpha), often set at 0.05.</p>
<p><strong>Type II Error (False Negative):</strong> Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false. The probability of a Type II error is denoted by  $ \beta $  (beta).</p>
<p><strong>Power (1 -  $ \beta $ ):</strong> The probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.  High power is desirable. <a href="./../power-analysis/">Power Analysis</a></p>
<p><strong>Factors Affecting <a href="./../statistical-significance/">Statistical Significance</a>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sample size:</strong> Larger samples generally lead to smaller p-values, increasing the likelihood of statistical significance.</li>
<li><strong>Effect size:</strong> The magnitude of the difference or relationship between variables. A larger effect size is more likely to yield statistical significance.</li>
<li><strong>Variance:</strong>  Higher variance in the data can make it harder to detect statistically significant effects.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpreting p-values:</strong>  A low p-value doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean the effect is large or practically important.  It only indicates the likelihood of the observed results occurring by chance. <a href="./../effect-size/">Effect Size</a></p>
<p><strong>Confidence Intervals:</strong> Provide a range of plausible values for a population parameter. A confidence interval that does not include the null hypothesis value suggests statistical significance.  A 95% confidence interval corresponds to an  $ \alpha $  level of 0.05.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship between Significance and Importance:</strong> Statistical significance does not imply practical significance. A result might be statistically significant but have a small effect size that is not meaningful in a real-world context.  (<a href="./../practical-significance/">Practical Significance</a>)</p>
<h2 id="--textp-value--ptextdata--h_0--">$$  \text{p-value} = P(\text{data} | H_0)  $$</h2>
<p>This equation represents the probability of observing the data given that the null hypothesis is true.  A small p-value suggests evidence against the null hypothesis.</p>
