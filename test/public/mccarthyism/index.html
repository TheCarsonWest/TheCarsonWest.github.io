<h2 id="when-early-1950s-roughly-1950-1956-peaking-around-1950-1954">When: Early 1950s (roughly 1950-1956, peaking around 1950-1954)</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Senator Joseph McCarthy:</strong> Republican Senator from Wisconsin, the most prominent figure associated with the movement.</li>
<li><strong>House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC):</strong> Congressional committee that investigated alleged communist activities.</li>
<li><strong>FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover:</strong> Played a significant role in providing information (sometimes unreliable) and encouraging anti-communist investigations.</li>
<li><strong>Individuals Accused:</strong> Government employees, academics, entertainers, labor union leaders, and other American citizens.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A period of intense anti-communist suspicion in the United States, characterized by unsubstantiated accusations of disloyalty, subversion, and communist sympathies.  McCarthy, through public speeches and Senate hearings, accused numerous individuals (often without credible evidence) of being communists or communist sympathizers. HUAC conducted similar investigations.  The term is often associated with reckless, unsubstantiated accusations and guilt by association. Many people lost their jobs and had their reputations ruined as a result of these accusations.</p>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Climate of Fear:</strong> Created a pervasive atmosphere of fear and suspicion throughout American society.  People were afraid to speak out against McCarthy or express dissenting opinions for fear of being labeled a communist.</li>
<li><strong>Erosion of Civil Liberties:</strong> Violated the civil liberties of many Americans, including freedom of speech and the right to due process.</li>
<li><strong>Blacklisting:</strong> Many individuals accused of communist ties were blacklisted, preventing them from finding employment in their fields.</li>
<li><strong>Damage to Reputations:</strong> Even when accusations were proven false, the damage to individuals&rsquo; reputations was often irreparable.</li>
<li><strong>Decline of McCarthy&rsquo;s Influence:</strong>  McCarthy&rsquo;s influence eventually declined after he began to accuse members of the US Army of being communists (Army-McCarthy Hearings in 1954).  He was censured by the Senate in 1954.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Impact on American Politics:</strong>  Demonstrated the potential dangers of political demagoguery and the importance of protecting civil liberties even in times of perceived national crisis. It also highlighted the impact of Cold War anxieties on domestic politics.</li>
