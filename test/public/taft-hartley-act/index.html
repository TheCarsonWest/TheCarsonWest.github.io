<h2 id="when-june-23-1947">WHEN: June 23, 1947</h2>
<h2 id="who">WHO:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Congress:</strong> Primarily Republican-controlled Congress.</li>
<li><strong>President:</strong> Initially vetoed by President Harry Truman (later overridden by Congress).</li>
<li><strong>Labor Unions:</strong> Targeted the power of labor unions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">WHAT:</h2>
<p>A federal law that amended the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935. Its main provisions included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outlawed the &ldquo;closed shop&rdquo; (requiring workers to be union members before being hired).</li>
<li>Permitted states to pass &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws (prohibiting union security agreements).</li>
<li>Banned jurisdictional strikes and secondary boycotts.</li>
<li>Required union leaders to take oaths that they were not communists.</li>
<li>Authorized the President to obtain injunctions to prevent strikes that threatened national health or safety (80-day &ldquo;cooling-off&rdquo; period).</li>
<li>Restricted union contributions to political campaigns.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">IMPACT: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weakened Labor Unions:</strong> Significantly curtailed the power and influence of labor unions, reversing some gains made during the [[New Deal]] era.</li>
<li><strong>Right-to-Work States:</strong> Led to the proliferation of right-to-work laws in many states, particularly in the South, which further hampered union organizing.</li>
<li><strong>Political Impact:</strong> Fuelled debate about labor rights and government regulation of the economy. Solidified a conservative backlash against the perceived excesses of the [[New Deal]] and the growing power of unions.</li>
<li><strong>Truman&rsquo;s Veto:</strong> Truman&rsquo;s initial veto, though overridden, solidified his support among labor unions and contributed to his unexpected victory in the 1948 election.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Decline of Union Membership:</strong> Contributed to the long-term decline of union membership in the United States.</li>
</ul>
