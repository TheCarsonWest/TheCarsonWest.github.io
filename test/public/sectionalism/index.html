<h2 id="id-sectionalism">ID: Sectionalism</h2>
<h2 id="when-1780s---1860s">When: 1780s - 1860s</h2>
<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>North:</strong> Industrialists, abolitionists, farmers in the Northeast and Midwest</li>
<li><strong>South:</strong> Plantation owners, slaveholders, farmers in the South</li>
<li><strong>West:</strong> Farmers, miners, and settlers moving westward</li>
<li><strong>Key figures:</strong> Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, Daniel Webster</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A deep-seated division in the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> based on geographic, economic, social, and political differences between the North, South, and West. These differences often led to conflict over issues like slavery, tariffs, and states&rsquo; rights.</p>
<p><strong>Key features of Sectionalism:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic differences:</strong> Industrial North vs. Agricultural South</li>
<li><strong>Social differences:</strong> Abolitionism in the North vs. Slaveholding in the South</li>
<li><strong>Political differences:</strong> Federalist vs. Democratic-Republican parties</li>
<li><strong>Territorial expansion:</strong> Debate over slavery in new territories</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased tension and conflict:</strong> <a href="./../sectionalism/">Sectionalism</a> fueled debates over slavery, westward expansion, and the role of the federal government, ultimately leading to the <a href="./../civil-war/">Civil War</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Compromises and political maneuvering:</strong> To maintain unity, political leaders attempted to forge compromises, such as the <a href="./../missouri/">Missouri</a> Compromise (1820) and the <a href="./../compromise-of-1850/">Compromise of 1850</a>. However, these often proved temporary and only deepened the divisions.</li>
<li><strong>Rise of sectional political parties:</strong> The rise of the Whig and Democratic parties reflected the growing divide between the North and South.</li>
<li><strong>Formation of the Confederate States of America:</strong> <a href="./../sectionalism/">Sectionalism</a> ultimately led to the secession of Southern states in 1860-1861 and the formation of the Confederacy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples of Sectional Conflicts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./../nullification/">Nullification</a> Crisis (1832-1833)</strong>: <a href="./../south-carolina/">South Carolina</a>&rsquo;s attempt to nullify the federal tariff.</li>
<li><strong>Mexican-American War (1846-1848)</strong>: Debate over the expansion of slavery into new territories.</li>
<li><strong><a href="./../compromise-of-1850/">Compromise of 1850</a>:</strong> A temporary solution to the issue of slavery in the territories, but further fueled tensions.</li>
<li><strong><a href="./../kansas/">Kansas</a>-<a href="./../nebraska-act/">Nebraska Act</a> (1854):</strong> Allowed for <a href="./../popular-sovereignty/">popular sovereignty</a> to decide on the issue of slavery in the territories, leading to violence and bloodshed in <a href="./../kansas/">Kansas</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857):</strong> Supreme Court decision that ruled that slaves were not citizens and had no rights, further dividing the nation.</li>
