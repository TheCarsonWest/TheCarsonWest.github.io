<p>This note covers the analysis of figurative language, focusing on identifying and interpreting different types of figures of speech.</p>
<p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> A direct comparison between two unlike things, stating one is the other.  Example:  &ldquo;The world is a stage.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Analysis: Consider the implications of the comparison. What qualities of the &ldquo;stage&rdquo; are being attributed to the &ldquo;world&rdquo;?  What effect does this have on the reader&rsquo;s understanding? [[Metaphor Analysis Techniques]]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simile:</strong> A comparison between two unlike things using &ldquo;like&rdquo; or &ldquo;as.&rdquo; Example: &ldquo;He fought like a lion.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Analysis: Similar to metaphor, examine the specific qualities being compared and the overall effect. [[Simile Analysis Techniques]]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Personification:</strong> Giving human qualities to inanimate objects or abstract ideas. Example: &ldquo;The wind whispered secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Analysis: What human characteristics are attributed? What is the effect of this personification on the tone or meaning? [[Personification Analysis]]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hyperbole:</strong> Extreme exaggeration for emphasis or effect. Example: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so hungry I could eat a horse.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Analysis: What is being exaggerated? What is the intended effect? Is it humorous, ironic, or serious? [[Hyperbole and its Effects]]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> The use of symbols to represent ideas or concepts.  Example: A dove symbolizing peace.</p>
<ul>
<li>Analysis: Identify the symbol and what it represents. What are the layers of meaning associated with the symbol?  Consider cultural context. [[Symbolism and Interpretation]]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metonymy:</strong>  Referring to something by naming an associated thing.  Example: &ldquo;The White House announced&hellip;&rdquo; (White House refers to the US government).</p>
<ul>
<li>Analysis: What is the relationship between the thing named and the thing it represents? What is the effect of this indirect naming? [[Metonymy Examples and Analysis]]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Synecdoche:</strong> A figure of speech where a part represents the whole, or the whole represents a part. Example: &ldquo;All hands on deck!&rdquo; (&ldquo;hands&rdquo; represents the sailors).</p>
<ul>
<li>Analysis: What is the part and what is the whole? What is the impact of using this figure of speech?  [[Synecdoche vs. Metonymy]]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Equations (for quantitative analysis, if applicable):</strong></p>
<p>Frequency of figurative language can be calculated:</p>
<p>$  \text{Frequency} = \frac{\text{Number of figures of speech}}{\text{Total number of words}}  $</p>
<p>This can be used to compare the density of figurative language across different texts.</p>
<h2 id="--textfigurative-language-density--fracsum_i1n-f_iw--">$$  \text{Figurative [[Language]] Density} = \frac{\sum_{i=[[1]]}^{n} F_i}{W}  $$</h2>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ F_i $  is the frequency of each type of figurative language.</li>
<li>$ n $  is the number of different types of figurative language.</li>
<li>$ W $  is the total number of words in the text.</li>
</ul>
