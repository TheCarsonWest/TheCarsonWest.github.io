The [[2425/apush/ids/u6/Fourteen Points]] proposed a series of principles to prevent future wars, including open diplomacy, freedom of the seas, arms reductions, self-determination for nationalities, and the creation of a [[2425/apush/ids/u6/League of Nations]].</h2>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Post-WWI Peace Efforts:</strong>  The [[2425/apush/ids/u6/Fourteen Points]] formed the basis for the Allied peace negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference. While not all points were fully adopted, they significantly influenced the [[2425/apush/ids/u6/Treaty of Versailles]] and the creation of the [[2425/apush/ids/u6/League of Nations]].</li>
<li><strong>Self-Determination:</strong> The principle of self-determination for nationalities inspired nationalist movements around the world and influenced the redrawing of national boundaries in Europe.</li>
<li><strong>[[2425/apush/ids/u6/League of Nations]]:</strong> The proposed [[2425/apush/ids/u6/League of Nations]], though ultimately flawed, represented a novel attempt at international cooperation and collective security, paving the way for future international organizations like the United Nations.</li>
<li><strong>US Senate Rejection:</strong>  The US Senate ultimately rejected the [[2425/apush/ids/u6/Treaty of Versailles]] (including the [[2425/apush/ids/u6/League of Nations]]) due to concerns about American sovereignty and involvement in international affairs. This rejection significantly impacted the US&rsquo;s role in the post-war world and contributed to the rise of isolationism.</li>
<li><strong>Idealism vs. Reality:</strong> The [[2425/apush/ids/u6/Fourteen Points]] demonstrated Wilson&rsquo;s idealistic vision for a peaceful and just world order, but it also highlighted the difficulties in translating such ideals into practical policy in the face of competing national interests and power struggles.</li>
