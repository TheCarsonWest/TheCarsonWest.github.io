The <a href="./../fourteen-points/">Fourteen Points</a> proposed a series of principles to prevent future wars, including open diplomacy, freedom of the seas, arms reductions, self-determination for nationalities, and the creation of a <a href="./../league-of-nations/">League of Nations</a>.</h2>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Post-WWI Peace Efforts:</strong>  The <a href="./../fourteen-points/">Fourteen Points</a> formed the basis for the Allied peace negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference. While not all points were fully adopted, they significantly influenced the <a href="./../treaty-of-versailles/">Treaty of Versailles</a> and the creation of the <a href="./../league-of-nations/">League of Nations</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Determination:</strong> The principle of self-determination for nationalities inspired nationalist movements around the world and influenced the redrawing of national boundaries in Europe.</li>
<li><strong><a href="./../league-of-nations/">League of Nations</a>:</strong> The proposed <a href="./../league-of-nations/">League of Nations</a>, though ultimately flawed, represented a novel attempt at international cooperation and collective security, paving the way for future international organizations like the United Nations.</li>
<li><strong>US Senate Rejection:</strong>  The US Senate ultimately rejected the <a href="./../treaty-of-versailles/">Treaty of Versailles</a> (including the <a href="./../league-of-nations/">League of Nations</a>) due to concerns about American sovereignty and involvement in international affairs. This rejection significantly impacted the US&rsquo;s role in the post-war world and contributed to the rise of isolationism.</li>
<li><strong>Idealism vs. Reality:</strong> The <a href="./../fourteen-points/">Fourteen Points</a> demonstrated Wilson&rsquo;s idealistic vision for a peaceful and just world order, but it also highlighted the difficulties in translating such ideals into practical policy in the face of competing national interests and power struggles.</li>
