<h2 id="who">Who:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR):</strong> Initiator and driving force behind the <a href="./../new-deal/">New Deal</a>.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Brain Trust&rdquo;:</strong> A group of advisors, including academics and intellectuals, who helped develop <a href="./../new-deal/">New Deal</a> policies.</li>

<li><strong>American Public:</strong> Beneficiaries and impacted by the various programs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">What:</h2>
<p>A series of programs and reforms enacted in the <a href="./../united-states/">United States</a> between 1933 and 1939 in response to the <a href="./../great-depression/">Great Depression</a>.  The <a href="./../new-deal/">New Deal</a> aimed to provide Relief for the unemployed, Recovery of the economy, and Reform to prevent future depressions (the &ldquo;3 R&rsquo;s&rdquo;). Key programs included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relief:</strong> Civilian Conservation Corps (<a href="./../ccc/">CCC</a>), Public Works Administration (PWA), Works Progress Administration (<a href="./../wpa/">WPA</a>), Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA).</li>
<li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Agricultural Adjustment Act (<a href="./../aaa/">AAA</a>), National Recovery Administration (NRA).</li>
<li><strong>Reform:</strong> Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Social Security Act.</li>
<li><strong><a href="./../wagner-act/">Wagner Act</a> (National Labor Relations Act - 1935):</strong> Guaranteed workers the right to organize and bargain collectively.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-why-significant">Impact: Why Significant?:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expanded Role of Government:</strong> Significantly increased the size and scope of the federal government in the lives of Americans.</li>
<li><strong>Social Safety Net:</strong> Established a precedent for government responsibility in providing a social safety net for citizens, including unemployment insurance, old-age pensions, and welfare programs.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure Development:</strong> Led to the construction of numerous public works projects, including dams, bridges, roads, and public buildings, many of which still exist today.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Recovery (Partial):</strong> Helped to alleviate some of the worst effects of the <a href="./../great-depression/">Great Depression</a>, but did not fully end it. World War II is largely credited with ending the Depression.</li>
<li><strong>Shift in Political Alignment:</strong> Solidified the Democratic Party&rsquo;s dominance and created a new coalition of voters, including urban workers, farmers, African Americans, and ethnic minorities.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy and Debate:</strong> The <a href="./../new-deal/">New Deal</a>&rsquo;s legacy is still debated today, with some arguing that it was a necessary and effective response to the Depression, while others criticize it for its cost, inefficiency, and expansion of government power.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Unionization:</strong> <a href="./../wagner-act/">Wagner Act</a> led to a significant increase in union membership and power.</li>
