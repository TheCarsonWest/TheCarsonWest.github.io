1. Describe the overall purpose of the program


    
     A useful part of the website is its integration with Markdown, a "programming language" that is super quick to learn and can provide really good looking pages. I achieved this not by doing the code myself, but by doing something that is essential to actual software development, stealing other people's code. In my original flowchart, I planned on doing this part myself, but I realized how slow and innefficient it would be to code this by hand, and I learned very quickly that someone had already done this exact thing. A project called [ShowdownJS](https://showdownjs.com/) does exactly what I need, converting markdown into HTML, and I decided to learn the documentation and then integrate it into my program.
     
    One of the tricky features of Markdown is that it allows you to make code blocks
    ```js
    console.log('Like this!');
    ``` 
    and to make a good looking code block, you need syntax formatting. If all the code was just white, there would be no point ot even using the feature, since it would just look ugly. Originally, if you go back to my first few commits, I was trying to make my own way of doig this, even to going as far as making my own terms in CSS for this.
