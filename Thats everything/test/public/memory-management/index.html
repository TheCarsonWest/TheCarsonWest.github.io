<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p>Python&rsquo;s memory management handles the allocation, deallocation, and tracking of memory resources used by a Python program. It operates in a way that&rsquo;s transparent to the programmer, allowing them to focus on writing code rather than managing memory-related details.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic <a href="./../memory-management/">Memory Management</a>:</strong></p>
<p>Python uses an automatic memory management system known as a &ldquo;garbage collector.&rdquo; The garbage collector is a background process that monitors the memory usage of objects and automatically reclaims the memory of objects that are no longer needed.</p>
<p><strong>Reference Counting:</strong></p>
<p>Python objects have reference counts that keep track of the number of references pointing to them. When a reference to an object is created, the object&rsquo;s reference count increases. When the reference is deleted, the reference count decreases. The garbage collector reclaims memory when an object&rsquo;s reference count reaches zero, indicating that no references to the object remain.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Automatic <a href="./../memory-management/">Memory Management</a>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Convenience:</strong> Automatic memory management removes the burden of memory management from the programmer, allowing them to focus on application development.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Bugs:</strong> It eliminates memory leaks and dangling pointers, which can cause errors and crashes in programs that rely on manual memory management.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Performance:</strong> The garbage collector is optimized to perform collection efficiently, allowing the application to run faster and smoother.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations of Automatic <a href="./../memory-management/">Memory Management</a>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overhead:</strong> The garbage collector needs to regularly pause the program to collect unused memory, which can cause slight performance overhead.</li>
<li><strong>Unpredictability:</strong> The timing of garbage collection can be unpredictable, especially in long-running programs, which can lead to issues in time-sensitive applications.</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="./../variables-and-data-types/">Variables and Data Types</a>: Objects in Python occupy memory and have reference counts.</li>
<li><a href="./../functions/">Functions</a>: Nested functions within a larger function can create reference cycles that make it difficult for the garbage collector to reclaim memory.</li>
<li><a href="./../closures/">Closures</a>: <a href="./../closures/">Closures</a> can retain references to variables in their enclosing scope, potentially keeping objects alive longer than necessary.</li>
<li><a href="./../garbage-collection/">Garbage Collection</a>: The garbage collector is a key component of Python&rsquo;s memory management system.</li>
<li><a href="./../thread-safety/">Thread Safety</a>: Multithreaded applications need to consider memory management issues related to thread safety and synchronization.</li>
