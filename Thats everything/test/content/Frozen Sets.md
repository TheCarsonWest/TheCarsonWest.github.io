## [Frozen [[Sets](./../frozen-[[sets/)

### Explanation
A frozen set in Python is an immutable set of unique elements. Once created, the elements cannot be added, removed, or modified. This makes frozen sets useful for representing static data that should not be altered.

### How to Use
To create a frozen set, use the `frozenset()` function:

```python
my_frozen_set = frozenset([1, 2, 3])
```

### Code Examples
```python
# create a frozen set of names
names = frozenset({"Alice", "Bob", "Carol"})

# add an element to a frozen set (error)
names.add("Dave")
```
